# PART 2 HOW TO SEE REALITY IN A MORE USEFUL WAY

[[toc]]

## THE MYTH OF THE RATIONAL MIND

Students of philosophy remember that Plato talked about the subjective nature of our personal realities in “The Allegory of the Cave” (Republic, 514a–520a). Plato asked us to imagine a group of people who lived their lives chained to a wall of a cave that faces another wall. On the wall they face, they see shadows of other people walking around in front of a fire elsewhere in the cave, but there is no way for the prisoners to see the other people directly. To this group of cave prisoners, the shadows themselves appear to be real creatures living independent lives. The prisoners would have no reason to think otherwise because the shadows would act and move like living creatures.

If you released the cave prisoners, they would soon learn about the properties of fire and shadows, and they would have to reinterpret their entire reality to fit the new data. The point of Plato’s allegory is that—figuratively speaking—we humans might be chained to a cave created by our own faulty brains and senses, experiencing a shadow world that is entirely different from objective reality.

Other famous philosophers, notably David Hume (born 1711), have questioned the nature of reality in terms of the existence of free will. If, as some philosophers claim, humans have no free will, and we are nothing but victims of cause and effect, that means our common view of reality is absurd. In this model of the world, we are little more than meat robots who wrongly believe we control our own decisions and actions.

Famous German philosopher Immanuel Kant (born 1724) held that the human mind creates the structure of human experience. He explained that our brains don’t have direct access to base reality—we have to settle for interpreting the input from our faulty senses. Kant uses a lot of words to say reality isn’t necessarily anything like the way we perceive it.

For the purpose of this book, you don’t need to accept any of these philosophical interpretations of reality. I only mention them to show that smart people throughout history have made arguments about the subjective nature of reality that are compatible with what you will read in these pages.

In more recent times, cognitive psychologists and physicists have discovered a lot of eye-opening stuff about the limits of human rationality. For example, Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, has written and lectured extensively on the topic of how humans believe they are using facts and reason to make decisions but in reality are easily swayed by bias from lots of different sources. Ariely wrote Predictably Irrational (2008).

The most famous voice in this realm is Robert Cialdini, a Regents’ Professor Emeritus of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University, and past visiting professor of marketing, business, and psychology at Stanford University. Cialdini’s two best-selling books, Influence (1984) and Pre-Suasion (2016), are master classes in the irrational nature of human decision making.

One place you would expect to find the highest level of human rationality is in financial markets, because trillions of dollars are on the line. But we don’t see that rationality, not from common investors and not even from financial professionals. Princeton economist Burton Malkiel taught us about irrational investors in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973). More recently, philosopher and statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote the hugely influential book The Black Swan (2007), which explains our human tendency to consistently misinterpret what we observe.

And what do physicists say about the nature of reality? That’s a mixed bag of weirdness. Much of what we know to be true by experiment makes absolutely no sense to our limited human brains. Two of my favorite examples are quantum entanglement and the double-slit experiment. I’ll spare you the wonky science, but if you do some reading on those topics, you will quickly learn that the human brain doesn’t have the capacity to understand the nature of reality.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom takes things one step further by asking whether we are a “real” species or a simulation created by an intelligent civilization that came before. This idea comes from the simple fact that we will someday be able to create software simulations that believe they are real creatures. And when we achieve that level of technical proficiency, we’re unlikely to stop with one simulation of that type. In the long run, you could expect far more simulated realities than the real one that started it all. So the math of it says we are far more likely to be a simulation than an original species. The interesting thing here is that neither the real species nor the simulations would be in a position to know which one they are. (But just for fun, in appendix C, I propose a way to figure out whether you are real or simulated.)

I mention these brilliant philosophers and scientists because they would all agree there are real limits on both human perception and human rationality.

I encourage you to remain skeptical about any details in this book, but it might help you to know I’m in good company—philosophically speaking—on the big picture: Humans think they are rational, and they think they understand their reality. But they are wrong on both counts.

## HOW STRONG IS PERSUASION?

Want to see something freaky?

Set this book aside and do an Internet search for “the McGurk effect.” Click on the first video you see. It is short. And it will blow your mind when you see how powerful persuasion can be.

Near the start of the clip, you see a close-up of a man’s mouth while he repeats, “Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.” You recognize his lips as forming the B in “bah,” and it all makes sense.

Then things get weird.

The soundtrack stays the same, but the man moves his lips as if he is forming the sound “fa, fa, fa” instead of “bah, bah, bah.” And while you watch, as if by magic, your brain turns the sound “bah” into “fa.” You know this is an illusion, and you know how they are doing it. And yet it still works. You can go back and forth between the lips that seem to be saying “fa” and the ones that seem to be saying “bah.” In reality, the sound is “bah” all the way from start to finish, but your brain will instantly translate the “bah” into “fa” when the lips on the video are moving as if they are creating an F sound.

This is a great example of how visual persuasion is more powerful than auditory persuasion. Our visual sense changes what we are hearing in real time, even when we know the illusion.

If you don’t have time to watch the video right now, make a point of doing it before you finish the book. You won’t fully appreciate the power of persuasion until you do.

The main theme of this book is that humans are not rational. We bounce from one illusion to another, all the while thinking we are seeing something we call reality. The truth is that facts and reason don’t have much influence on our decisions, except for trivial things, such as putting gas in your car when you are running low. On all the important stuff, we are emotional creatures who make decisions first and rationalize them after the fact.

If you are normal, or anything like normal, you probably think I am exaggerating about how irrational we human beings are. Perhaps you don’t feel irrational. But consider the U.S. election of 2016, in which Donald J. Trump unexpectedly beat Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College to win the election. I think it is obvious that roughly half of the people in the United States made a deeply irrational decision in that election. But which half?

As a general rule, irrational people don’t know they are irrational. After the election results came in, both halves of the country accused the other half of being irrational.

As a trained hypnotist, I can tell you with confidence that both halves were right.

### THE PERSUASION FILTER
The common view of reality is that the way you see the world is not only accurate but universally shared. For all I know, that might be true. But it might also be the case that reality is something quite different from what you perceive. That possibility might feel unlikely to you. Watch me change your mind. I’ll do it by explaining my personal journey through what I call the filters.

The key concept of a filter is that it is not intended to give you an accurate view of reality. All it is supposed to do is give you better results than other filters. And I propose that the best way to objectively determine the usefulness of a filter is by asking if it makes you happy and also does a good job of predicting the future. The Persuasion Filter (the main topic of this book) does a great job of making people happy, or so I observe. And it did a great job predicting a number of unlikely events in the presidential election of 2016. That’s what I call a good filter.

What I don’t claim is that the Persuasion Filter is an accurate view of reality. I have no reason to believe humans evolved with the capability to understand their reality. That capability was not important to survival. When it comes to evolution, any illusion that keeps us alive long enough to procreate is good enough.

I’ll give you a tour of the filters I have used over my lifetime to give you an idea of what I mean.

### THE SANTA CLAUS FILTER
When I was a child, it was customary for adults to indoctrinate kids with an entertaining belief in magic of all kinds. For several years of my youth, I thought Santa Claus was real. I also believed in the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Superman.

My filter on life allowed all sorts of magical creatures to exist. The interesting part—and the lesson here—is that this total misconception about reality did an excellent job of keeping me happy and predicting the future. There was no penalty for being totally wrong about reality.

I liked toys, and I liked knowing Santa was efficient, punctual, immortal, and suspiciously generous. I liked knowing that the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny would deliver the goods too. It was a great filter on reality until I was old enough to realize there were simply too many chimneys and too little time for Santa to get the job done. And his sled was totally undersized. The numbers didn’t add up. The other magical creatures that inhabited my filter also faded in the light of what I assumed was my higher level of knowledge and reason.

But I was wrong. All I did was move to another filter with new characters.

### THE CHURCH FILTER
From the ages of about six to eleven, I attended Sunday school at the Methodist church that was a short walk from my house. I believed everything the church told me because I didn’t see any reason they would put so much energy into a centuries-long, elaborate lie. And I assumed all those people couldn’t be wrong.

As a child, I understood that other religions existed. But the Methodist Church explained away that discrepancy in my filter by saying all the other religions were wrong. That seemed reasonable to me. And it seemed that 100 percent of the people in my small town of Windham, New York, were Christians of one flavor or another. In hindsight, I assume the atheists were just staying off the radar.

My church filter worked great most of the time. I was happy that I would go to heaven. But the filter didn’t seem to do a great job of predicting anything while I was still alive. Prayers didn’t seem to influence my outcomes in any reliable way. And no one could predict the next miracle, or the birth of the next saint. I was starting to have my doubts about the church filter.

One day in Sunday school we learned a Bible story about Jonah and the giant fish. The quick version of the story is that Jonah was about to drown in the ocean and God sent a giant fish to save him. The fish accomplished this task by swallowing Jonah whole. Jonah then lived for three days in the belly of the fish, praying to God. After three days, God told the fish to spit out Jonah, and it did. Miraculously (literally), Jonah was none the worse for living in stomach acid without oxygen for three days.

That was the tipping point for me. I called a meeting with my mother and announced that I was discontinuing my religious education. I explained my new hypothesis that she and all other believers were being duped for reasons I couldn’t understand, but I planned to get to the bottom of it. My mother listened to my reasoning, acknowledged that I was making a well-informed decision, and never asked me to attend church again. My mom was awesome that way.

Once the church filter fell away, I suddenly found myself living in an absurd world. According to my new worldview, I was the only person—as far as I knew—who could see religion for the scam that it was. Obviously there were plenty of nonbelievers in the world, but they were invisible to me in my pre-Internet, small-town life. I needed a new filter to describe how an eleven-year-old boy could be the only one in the world who saw reality for what it really was. To explain my situation I came up with . . .

### THE ALIEN EXPERIMENT FILTER
The alien experiment filter imagined that intelligent creatures from another world impregnated my mother so they could find out what happens when humans and aliens mate. According to that filter, the aliens were watching me at all times. I accepted this as true (enough) for several years of my childhood.

The alien experiment filter did a good job of explaining why I was so different from the people in my town, but it didn’t make me happy, and it wasn’t any good for predicting what would happen next. It wasn’t a useful filter. Eventually I dropped that filter in favor of . . .

### THE ATHEIST FILTER
The atheist filter imagines that there is no supreme being. It also imagines that humans are rational creatures and they can understand their environment through observation, science, and reason. This filter was a perfect fit for a rebellious young man. It gave me something juicy to argue about, and I did, whenever anyone would listen. I enjoyed the debates, but I can’t say that my atheist filter ever made me happy. Nor did it do a great job of predicting the future, except that I could predict that my prayers would not be answered, and no miracles would happen while I was watching. But those are special cases. As a general rule, I couldn’t predict anything using the atheist filter. The atheist filter might turn out to be one of the more accurate views of reality, but that mattered less to me than the fact that it wasn’t useful. It didn’t make me happy and it didn’t help me predict what would happen next. But there were more filters to come.

### THE WEED FILTER
I smoked a lot of marijuana in college. One of the most puzzling aspects of being high was that the people around me who were not high seemed nicer than usual. For years I assumed I was only imagining that people were being extra nice to me when I was high. The simplest explanation for my subjective experience was that the drug was altering my perception of the world.

I started to feel as if I had one reality when I was normal and an entirely different reality when I was high. The interesting thing is that both of those realities worked fine. When I was high, I could still navigate the world and do all the things that people do. There were a few activities, such as studying for tests, that I didn’t do as well when high. And driving was a bad idea. But for most daily activities there was no important difference in how I performed. That’s when I started to realize that people could be living in different realities while inhabiting the same room. I knew from my own experience that I could experience two realities in the same room just by going from normal to high.

In later years I came to understand why everyone seemed so much nicer to me when I was high. It turns out that people were actually nicer to me. And there is a perfectly good reason: My cheery and relaxed attitude while high was rubbing off on the people around me. My other reality—the one in which I was not high—brought out my more intense, ambitious, and introspective personality. People respond to that personality with less friendliness because I look like I’m all business, and it rubs off on them. I wasn’t perceiving reality to be different when I was high—I was causing it to be different.

Here again we can see that the true nature of reality—if such a thing exists—was somewhat irrelevant to my day-to-day life. My reality made perfect sense when I believed I was only imagining that people were acting nicer to me when I was high. And reality still made sense when I realized (or believed) I was causing that niceness by my own demeanor. The choice of filter didn’t make much difference to my life.

The weed filter was a big improvement over my past filters because it made me happy (obviously), but it also had some predictive power. When I was high, I knew people would respond to me in a certain way, on average, and they did. Or so it seemed. And that’s all that mattered. But the weed filter is limited, at best.

### THE MUSHROOM FILTER
I moved to San Francisco at age twenty-one, and a friend talked me into trying psychedelic mushrooms. It was the best day of my life, at least in terms of pure joy. And that isn’t an exaggeration. No other experience has ever come close. But while the pleasure was temporary—literally just a spike in certain brain chemistry—the experience left me permanently changed. As those of you who have tried psychedelics already know, words can’t describe the experience. But I’ll try to explain it in the limited context of filters.

When you are on mushrooms, you understand the world around you, and you can operate within it. But at the same time, you become aware that your interpretation of your reality is fluid. You see ordinary items almost as if you are an alien visiting this strange world for the first time, but for some odd reason you know what everything is and what it does. In other words, you become aware that your perceptions are independent from the underlying reality. That awareness never leaves you. Once you understand your experience of life as an interpretation of reality, you can’t go back to your old way of thinking. After taking psychedelics, you might stop seeing your old interpretation of reality as the only “true” version. That’s what happened to me.

Kids, please don’t take drugs. Drugs can be dangerous. I don’t recommend trying marijuana or psychedelics. You’ll get a similar perceptual shift by reading this book. I designed it to do exactly that. In other words, I took all of those drugs so you don’t have to. You’re welcome.

### THE MOIST ROBOT FILTER
My current filter on life is what I call the moist robot filter. I wrote about it in detail in my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. The summary is that human brains are moist computers that can be reprogrammed if you know where the user interface is. For example, we know that going to school can change the physical structure of your brain by making it form new connections and new memories. That part is obvious. But there are lots of other ways to reprogram your brain to develop useful habits, change your energy level, hack your happiness, and more. The moist robot filter assumes your brain is subject to the laws of physics and doesn’t have any magical qualities such as free will or a soul.

For our purposes here, we don’t need to debate whether humans have free will or souls. Remember, filters are not about knowing reality. The role of a filter is limited to making you happy and helping you predict the future. Humans don’t always need to know the true nature of reality in order to live well. The moist robot filter is the filter that makes me happiest, and it does the best job of predicting. The Persuasion Filter—the topic of this book—is a subset of the moist robot worldview. As moist robots, we are easily influenced by emotional and irrational factors. If you learn the mechanisms of this influence, you have found the user interface for human beings. So when I talk about the Persuasion Filter, you should understand that it is fully compatible with the moist robot idea. Or to put it another way, my How to Fail book was about persuading yourself, and this book is about persuading others.

### THE PERSUASION FILTER
The most common opinion that we humans have of ourselves is that we are rational creatures—let’s say 90 percent of the time, anyway. But every now and then we get a little emotional and temporarily lose our sense of reason. That’s how most people see the world. I did too until I trained to become a hypnotist.


Hypnotists see the world differently. From our perspective, people are irrational 90 percent of the time but don’t know it. We can be rational in trivial situations—such as deciding what time to leave the house to drive to work. But we are almost never rational when it comes to matters of love, family, pets, politics, ego, entertainment, and almost anything else that matters to us emotionally. When our feelings turn on, our sense of reason shuts off. The freaky part is that we don’t recognize when it is happening to us. We think we are reasonable and rational most of the time. But what hypnotists have long known, and scientists have in recent years confirmed, is that our decisions are often made without appeal to the rational parts of our brains. We literally make our decisions first and then create elaborate rationalizations for them after the fact.

Freaky, right?

The grand illusion of life is that our minds have the capacity to understand reality. But human minds didn’t evolve to understand reality. We didn’t need that capability. A clear view of reality wasn’t necessary for our survival. Evolution cares only that you survive long enough to procreate. And that’s a low bar. The result is that each of us is, in effect, living in our own little movie that our brain has cooked up for us to explain our experiences.

Let me give you an example.

Let’s say that you believe you are reincarnated from an earlier life in which you were a Tibetan monk. And let’s say I think my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse. Those are very different movies. But it doesn’t matter to our survival that we are experiencing different realities. As long as humans procreate and create more humans, evolution has done its job. Evolution doesn’t care if you see the world for what it is. It only cares that you make more of yourself.

Here’s an example of why the idea that humans are rational is pure nonsense. One of my Twitter followers copied President Trump’s inauguration speech and showed it to a “leftist friend,” telling him it was President Obama’s speech. His friend loved it.


I watched President Trump’s inauguration address on television while live-streaming to several hundred people on the Periscope app. Most of the people who commented to me directly were touched by the inclusiveness and optimism in Trump’s message. There were many tears.

But within the hour, I received an e-mail from one of my best friends, a virulent anti-Trumper, who said this:

I was quite surprised by Trump’s speech. I thought all inaugural addresses include soaring language and hope for the future. This one sounded like his stump speech (but without the insults). Lots of anti-Washington rhetoric. It was the most negative tone I can remember hearing. No “Ask not what your country can do for you.” No “shining city on the hill.”

I also expected to hear more reaching out to others. “Not all of you voted for me, but I will be the President of all the people.” That used to be pretty standard stuff as well. I guess Trump just does it his way, and we need to get used to it.

That interpretation is literally the opposite of what I heard and saw. This odd difference in observation is not unusual. Both my friend and I follow politics. We’re both smart. (He’s smarter.) Neither of us lied about our reaction to Trump’s speech. But we saw entirely different movies playing on the same screen at the same time. If you think this different-movies situation is rare, you’re living in what I call the second dimension. In the third dimension, where persuasion rules, it is entirely normal and routine for different movies to play on the same screen at the same time.

But if each of us is living in our own little movie, which one is best?

I submit that the best filter on politics is the one that makes you happy and is the most accurate at predicting what will happen next. I used the Persuasion Filter to predict Trump’s presidency when others thought it was madness. And I predicted a lot of steps along the way that I’ll describe in this book. All of my predictions were public. You can check them for yourself.

But even if I were to convince you that the Persuasion Filter is the best way to predict the future, you will still wonder how humans could be so delusional and not realize it. And to understand that you must understand two concepts: cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias. These two concepts explain almost everything that puzzles you about why people act the way they do. And they explain the 2016 election in a way nothing else can.

## COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
Wikipedia gives us a useful definition of cognitive dissonance:

In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time; performs an action that is contradictory to their beliefs, ideas, or values; or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.1

The science around cognitive dissonance is deep, but you don’t need any of that depth to be a good persuader. All you need to understand is the basic idea of cognitive dissonance and—this is important—how often it happens in your daily experience. I told you the normal view of the world is that we are rational 90 percent of the time and we get a little crazy 10 percent of the time. The Persuasion Filter’s view of the world is that we’re irrational 90 percent of the time. And one of the biggest sources of this irrationality is cognitive dissonance.

The most common trigger for cognitive dissonance is when a person’s self-image doesn’t fit their observations. For example, if you believe you are a smart and well-informed person, and then you do something that is clearly dumb, it sends you into a state of cognitive dissonance. And once you are in that uncomfortable state of mind, your brain automatically generates an illusion to solve the discomfort. In this situation, your brain would tell you the new information was inaccurate. The alternative is to believe that you are dumb, and that violates your self-image. You don’t like to change your self-image unless it is in the direction of improvement.

Our egos prevent us from imagining we are irrational 90 percent of the time. When we recognize ourselves acting irrationally, the simplest course of action for the brain is to generate an illusion that explains it all away. And so it does. Automatically. The fun part is that we are not aware when it is happening. Others might be able to see it happening in you as clear as day. But by its nature, cognitive dissonance is invisible to the person experiencing it.

### HOW TO SPOT COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
When you experience cognitive dissonance, you spontaneously generate a hallucination that becomes your new reality. To outside observers, the hallucination might look ridiculous. But to the person experiencing the hallucination it all makes perfect sense. So the first thing you need to know about cognitive dissonance is that you can often recognize it in others, and they can recognize it in you, but recognizing it in yourself is rare.

Trained hypnotists can sometimes recognize cognitive dissonance when they are in it. Cognitive scientists can probably do it sometimes too. But for those untrained in the art of persuasion, experiencing cognitive dissonance feels exactly like an accurate view of reality. You can’t tell the difference.

The first “tell” for cognitive dissonance is the absurdity of the rationalization. For example, you might be friends with a cigarette smoker who claims smoking won’t hurt him because he knows someone who smoked a pack a day and lived to be a hundred years old. The person who makes that sort of argument is simply addicted to smoking but doesn’t like to think of himself as being unwise or unable to quit. That would violate the person’s self-image. To keep his self-image intact, the smoker generates a personal illusion in which he is one of the few people in the world who are immune to lung cancer and somehow know it.

We live in an irrational world in which people are continually saying and doing absurd-looking things. Sometimes those people are just dumb, and that’s the entire explanation for why they are doing dumb-looking things. Sometimes the problem is on your end, and the things that others are doing look absurd to you only because you don’t understand why they do what they do. There can be lots of false positives when you look for cognitive dissonance because there is so much run-of-the-mill irrationality everywhere that any special flavor of it can easily hide. The best way to know you are seeing cognitive dissonance and not routine irrationality is to look for the trigger. The trigger is whatever made the person realize that their own actions were in conflict with their self-image.

In the smoking example, some people admit they are addicted and say they enjoy smoking, and so they put up with the high risks. Those people are probably not experiencing cognitive dissonance because they understand the risks and causation correctly.

But a smoker who refuses to admit that addiction is central to the habit—perhaps because the person has too much confidence in his own self-control—has to invent a hallucination for why a smart person with self-control would do such a damaging thing as smoking. That incongruity is the trigger. The person’s self-image doesn’t match his own actions.

The presidential election of 2016 provided the biggest trigger for cognitive dissonance you might ever see in your lifetime. It had all the elements for generating mass hallucinations. From the moment that Trump announced his candidacy, the professional political class started mocking his intelligence, his commitment, his talent, and—most important—his chances of winning. The pundits believe they are smart, and they believe they can see the world for what it is. And in the case of Trump, it seemed to them the easiest prediction in the world, at least for people so well informed and rational. What mattered the most here, in terms of the trigger, is not that these folks were so wrong. People are wrong all the time, and it doesn’t always cause hallucinations. The key variable in this case was their certainty. And it was public certainty, repeated loudly and often. Their opinions of Trump became part of their self-image. They saw themselves as the smart ones, in stark contrast to what they imagined were the Trump supporters with their mullets and pickup trucks.

And then Trump won. By a comfortable margin, at least in the Electoral College, which is the only place it matters. Trump lost the popular vote, but that was a case of losing a game he wasn’t playing.

Trump’s win was the trigger. The pundits and the voters who believed they were the smart ones suddenly learned they were not. And they learned it in the clearest possible way. They were wrong about the voters in swing states. They were wrong to trust the polls. They were wrong to underestimate Trump’s intelligence. They were wrong to underestimate his campaign’s effectiveness. They were wrong about his need to do traditional advertising. They were wrong about his ground game. They were wrong in thinking that his provocative statements would end him. They were wrong to believe that his alleged scandals would end him. They were wrong about his tweeting being a bad idea. They were wrong that Trump would cause down-ticket Republicans to lose. They were wrong about just about everything.

They were so wrong that Republicans came to occupy the White House, control Congress, and eventually control the Supreme Court. That is wrongness on a scale you rarely see.

To make matters worse, they had to watch a number of smart people such as Ann Coulter, Mike Cernovich, Stefan Molyneux, and Milo Yiannopoulos call this entire process correctly from start to finish. If everyone in the world had been wrong about Trump, it would be easier to write it off as a fluke that no reasonable person could have seen coming. That wasn’t an option in this case because a number of smart and prominent Trump supporters were right about everything, from the start. We gave our reasons—loudly and often—and showed our work all the way.

A year before the election I said this in my blog:

Trump’s persuasion skills would set off a swarm of competing (and wrong) explanations for why Trump is defying expectations.

In other words, I saw the conditions forming for massive cognitive dissonance long before anyone else mentioned it publicly, as far as I know. That’s how a background in persuasion lets you see the future that others can’t. It’s a learned skill, not a psychic power. If you know what causes cognitive dissonance, you can sometimes see the conditions forming from miles away.

And sure enough, Trump’s win set off a cluster bomb of cognitive dissonance the likes of which history rarely sees. To untrained observers—voters and pundits alike—the public reaction looked like a combination of anger, disappointment, fear, and shock. But to trained persuaders, it was a front-row seat to a show of cognitive dissonance so pure and so deep that it was, frankly, beautiful.

Most people didn’t appreciate the show. What they saw instead was an endless stream of after-the-fact “reasons” to explain their new reality in which someone like Trump could get elected.

A few days after the election, CNN.com listed twenty-four different theories from pundits to explain why Trump won. I present them below as entries that don’t make complete sense out of context, but trust me when I say the context doesn’t matter in this specific case. Many of the explanations sound quite reasonable, but the credibility of the explanations is not related to my point about spotting cognitive dissonance. The tell is not the quality of the explanations. The tell is how many of them there are.

If you have a situation that can be explained with one reasonable explanation, that reason might be close to reality. But having lots of different explanations is usually a clear tell for cognitive dissonance. Having multiple explanations—no matter how reasonable they sound after the fact—means people are trying to make sense of their observations, and they are generating different illusions to do it. Here are some of the explanations for Trump’s unexpected win, from CNN’s article.

1. Facebook was unable or unwilling to crack down on fake news.
1. Social media.
1. Low voter turnout.
1. Celebrity outlasts substance.
1. White women were more important than anyone thought.
1. White male resentment.
1. Russian hacking and fake news.
1. The Left and coastal elites shamed Trump supporters.
1. Rural midwesterners don’t get out of the house enough.
1. The Democratic Party establishment didn’t push Bernie Sanders.
1. Reagan Democrats surged in Michigan and the Midwest.
1. The media focused too much on millennial voters, not enough on older white males.
1. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein took votes.
1. College-educated Americans are out of touch.
1. Political correctness set off a nasty backlash.
1. Trump listened to the American people.
1. Americans are biased against the ruling class in Washington DC.
1. Voters believed the system was corrupt.
1. Trump remembered “forgotten men, women” of America.
1. Democrats focused more on turning out supporters than on growing the base.
1. The Democratic National Committee selected the less competitive candidate.
1. Not because of racism. Voters just preferred Trump.
1. FBI Director Comey’s announcements about Clinton’s e-mails came just weeks before election day.
1. Clinton was a bad candidate.
1. The media explainers weren’t done yet. Some experts pointed out that the candidate of change has a big advantage, so we should have seen it coming. But if the “change” pattern is so predictive, why didn’t the experts use it to predict? And why do we believe that all the other Republican candidates would have lost to Clinton when, after all, they too represented big change?

And nowhere in the list of explanations for Trump’s win do pundits and pollsters blame themselves for telling Clinton supporters her win was assured. I have to think the media’s confidence in her win caused some people to skip voting.

> PERSUASION TIP 7
> It is easy to fit completely different explanations to the observed facts. Don’t trust any interpretation of reality that isn’t able to predict.

Many of the after-the-fact explanations make perfect sense. But keep in mind that it is easy to fit a wide variety of explanations to the past. Trial lawyers do it every day. The prosecution and the defense present two different narratives to explain the observed facts, and both can sound convincing. The prosecution says the accused owned the murder weapon, so obviously he is guilty. The defense points out that the accused had roommates, and they had access to the gun too, so maybe one of the roommates did it. Same facts, different stories. And both stories can sound perfectly credible.

### THE AFTER-ELECTION DANGER
After the election results came in, people expected me to gloat. You could say I earned it. I had just pulled off the upset prediction of the century while enduring more than a year of nonstop abuse from pro-Clinton and Republican establishment types. If anyone ever had a good reason to gloat, I did.

But I couldn’t. I knew how dangerous the situation was. I knew people would experience a form of temporary insanity. Cognitive dissonance by itself isn’t always dangerous. But if you combine that with the illusion that some sort of Hitler had just become leader of the country—and that’s what the anti-Trumpers believed—we had a risk of riots, violence, and a breakdown of our entire system.

I wanted to gloat, but I’m a patriot first, and the country needed some calm voices. I took to my blog, Twitter, and Periscope to persuade Trump supporters to back away from the gloating that they too had earned. By this point in the election saga, Trump supporters recognized me as a credible voice about politics. My reputation was reinforced by Trump’s win. Suddenly I had influence like never before. I had the ears and eyes of the media. I had a huge audience. And I had a very big problem to help solve.

I don’t normally turn up my persuasion powers to weapons grade. But I can. This time, with the republic in the balance, I felt I needed to. And so I picked one of the strongest persuasion tools: the High-Ground Maneuver (described more fully in its own chapter later in the book).

I used my social media platform to remind Trump supporters that they are patriots first, and their country needed them for the healing. I asked them to take punches from Clinton supporters and not fight back. I asked them to avoid gloating in public. I asked them to be the better people. I asked them to earn the leader they believed they elected. In other words, I took them to the high ground.

Did my persuasion make any difference?

There is no way to tell. But I was impressed at how well Trump supporters handled their win. For the most part, they didn’t confront protesters. They didn’t gloat nearly as much as I would have expected. They found the high ground, perhaps on their own, and simply enjoyed the show as the mainstream media tried to do brain surgery on itself to find out where the problem was.

By election day I had over 100,000 social media followers, and they tweeted and retweeted anything interesting I said. For a year I had been one of them, gaining their trust. When I was ready to lead, they were primed to follow. All the elements were in place for my persuasion to make a huge dent in the national consciousness, both directly and through my influence on other writers. Good ideas travel from person to person, and often they lose their connection to the source over time. It is nearly impossible to measure one person’s persuasion in this sort of situation. All I know for sure is that I did my best. That’s what my patriotism required. I’m glad it worked out. As I write this, the “Trump is Hitler” illusion has largely passed.

Nice job, Americans, and a hat tip to the founders, who created this robust system. I continue to be astonished at our Constitution’s power over our minds. But I shouldn’t be surprised, given that Master Persuaders wrote it.

How do I know the founders of America were Master Persuaders?

You’ll find out before the end of this book.

#### SPOTTING TELLS FOR COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
Over the years, I have noticed a variety of tells for when a person is experiencing cognitive dissonance. This comic gives you a classic example of what it looks like.

The comic is based on common patterns I observe on Twitter. When I see someone get triggered into cognitive dissonance—either by me or by anyone else—I often see a similar pattern of response. The pattern is so persistent that it is spooky. And once I describe it, you’ll start seeing it all the time.

As far as I can tell, the most frequent tells for cognitive dissonance on Twitter take this form:

[A mocking word or acronym] + [an absurd absolute]

or . . .

[A mocking word or acronym] + [a personal insult that is more aggressive than the situation seems to warrant]


Regarding the first tell, when people do not have rational reasons for their views—and you help them achieve that realization—they typically and immediately hallucinate that your argument is some kind of absurd absolute instead of whatever reasonable thing you actually said. That instant hallucination provides the critic something with which they can easily disagree. For example, if you make a solid argument on Twitter in favor of private gun ownership, and it triggers cognitive dissonance in some random stranger, you might see a response like this from the stranger: “LOL. I guess you want to give guns to toddlers!”

In that example, the “LOL” is the mocking acronym, and the absurd absolute is the mischaracterization of your opinion as wanting to give guns to toddlers. The most common mocking words and abbreviations on Twitter are these:

1. Wow
1. OMG
1. So . . .
1. In other words . . .
1. HAHAHAHA! (the exaggerated laugh)
1. Dude
1. The list is not exhaustive, but I think you get the pattern. The start of the tweet generally contains contempt, mocking, or sarcasm. The second part of the tweet includes either an insult that seems too angry for the situation or a mischaracterization of your point as an absurd absolute.

As a public service, I described in my blog a way to know you won an argument on the Internet by spotting cognitive dissonance. Here are some additional tells you might find familiar.

::: tip How to Know You Won a Political Debate on the Internet

Posted May 15, 2017

#### Analogy

Analogies are good for explaining concepts for the first time. But they have no value in debate. Analogies are not logic, and they are not relevant facts. An analogy is literally just two things that remind you of each other on at least one dimension. When I see a cauliflower, it reminds me of a human brain, but that doesn’t mean you should eat brains in your salad. When your debate opponents retreat to analogies, it is because they have no rational arguments. You won.

There’s a reason your plumber never describes the source of your leak with an analogy. He just points to the problem and says it needs to be repaired or replaced. No one needs an analogy when facts and reason can do the job.

#### An Attack on the Messenger

When people realize their arguments are not rational, they attack the messenger on the other side. If you have been well behaved in a debate, and you trigger an oversized personal attack, it means you won. When people have facts and reasons in their armory, they use them first. When they run out of rational arguments, they attack the messenger. That is the equivalent of throwing the gun at the monster after you run out of bullets.

People are mean on the Internet all the time. Being an ordinary jerk might not be a tell for cognitive dissonance. But when you see an attack that seems far angrier than the situation calls for, that’s usually cognitive dissonance.

#### The Psychic Psychiatrist Illusion

The psychic psychiatrist illusion involves imagining you can discern the inner thoughts and motives of strangers. I’m talking about the unspoken thoughts and feelings of strangers, not the things they have actually said. If your debate opponents retreat to magical thinking about their abilities to detect secret motives and mental problems in strangers from a distance, you won.
::: 

I’m not aware of any science to back up my description of the tells for cognitive dissonance. But generally speaking, if your debate partner leaves the realm of fact and reason for any of the diversions I mentioned, you just won the debate. Declare victory and bow out.

You can sometimes spot your own cognitive dissonance via the same set of tells you would observe in others. But that is harder because the nature of cognitive dissonance is that the person experiencing it can’t see it for what it is. If you catch yourself rationalizing away one of the tells I mentioned in this chapter as not applicable in your situation, that’s a red flag you shouldn’t ignore. And by the end of this book, you should have a lower confidence in your ability to identify base reality, which gives you psychological permission to be wrong without needing to hallucinate that you are right.

My disclaimer for this lesson: This is my opinion alone, based on observation. I advise you to maintain some skepticism, but watch how often you start seeing the pattern now that I’ve explained it.

And if you do see the pattern, don’t rule out the possibility that you and I are both experiencing confirmation bias and there is no real pattern at all.

## CONFIRMATION BIAS
The world can be a confusing place if you don’t know what confirmation bias is and how often it occurs in our daily lives. Confirmation bias is the human reflex to interpret any new information as being supportive of the opinions we already hold. And it doesn’t matter how poorly the new information fits our existing views. We will twist our minds into pretzels to make the new information feel as if it is consistent with what we “know” to be true.

For example, as I write this chapter, news services are reporting a variety of stories about alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign staff, but we have seen no actual evidence of it. On top of the collusion allegations are stories about alleged Russian “influence” on the election that doesn’t involve any collusion; those stories appear to have more substance. But the interesting thing is that the anti-Trumpers and the Trump supporters are seeing different realities based on the same set of reported facts. Trump’s enemies say there is so much smoke (Russia-related allegations) that there must be a fire (collusion). Trump’s supporters say no evidence has been presented for collusion (true at this writing) and so he has been “proven” innocent of collusion by lack of evidence.

Both positions are nonsense.

The “smoke” that Trump’s critics are seeing is largely of their own making. If there are enough Russia-related election stories, and you hear enough people speculate about what might have happened, it starts to feel like a mountain of “evidence.” Yet no evidence of collusion has been made public (at this writing).

Trump’s supporters are just as delusional. They see a lack of evidence as proof of innocence. But you can’t prove something doesn’t exist just because you didn’t see it in the places you looked.

The important takeaway here is that citizens for and against President Trump are looking at the same information and coming to opposite conclusions. And neither of the conclusions is sensible. That’s confirmation bias. Obviously every individual is different, but on average, Trump’s opponents believe they see something that doesn’t exist (evidence of collusion) while Trump’s supporters believe they see something else that doesn’t exist (proof there was no collusion).

If you don’t understand confirmation bias, you might think new information can change people’s opinions. As a trained persuader, I know that isn’t the case, at least when emotions are involved. People don’t change opinions about emotional topics just because some information proved their opinion to be nonsense. Humans aren’t wired that way.

Confirmation bias is one of the many reasons you should not solely rely on past experience to predict the future. Those facts that you think you know from the past might be confirmation bias, and not facts at all.

Most people know what confirmation bias is, if not by its name, then certainly by personal experience. We all know how hard it is to change a person’s mind about anything important, even when all of the facts are on our side. But what nonpersuaders usually don’t realize is how prevalent confirmation bias is. Confirmation bias isn’t an occasional bug in our human operating system. It is the operating system. We are designed by evolution to see new information as supporting our existing opinions, so long as it doesn’t stop us from procreating. Evolution doesn’t care if you understand your reality. It only cares that you reproduce. It also wants you to conserve energy for the important stuff, such as surviving. The worst thing your brain could do is reinterpret your reality into a whole new movie with each new bit of information. That would be exhausting and without benefit. Instead, your brain takes the path of least resistance and instantly interprets your observations to fit your existing worldview. It’s just easier.

## MASS DELUSIONS
If you don’t know how frequently mass delusions occur in your daily experience, many of your opinions about the world are likely to be nonsense. That’s because mass delusions are the norm for humanity, not the exception.

Don’t believe me?

It is easy to check. Just ask your neighbors about their religious and political views. You’ll find plenty of disagreement with your worldview. And so, according to you, your neighbors and all the people who agree with them must be living in some sort of hallucination. How can they believe they are reincarnated when you know that death means either heaven or hell? You and your neighbor can’t both be right. One of you (at least) is experiencing a little piece of a larger mass delusion.

And the problem isn’t limited to your neighbors. Millions of people share the same mass delusions (according to you).

Do you remember when millions of Americans believed President Obama was a secret Muslim? That was a mass delusion.

Do you remember when President Trump got elected and there were protests in the street because they thought he was the next Hitler? That was a mass delusion.

Do you remember the dot-com bubble? That was based on mass delusions about the value of money-losing start-ups. Every other financial bubble was also a mass delusion.

Below is a starter list of the more notable mass delusions. Wikipedia lists over thirty examples of mass hysteria through the years. But those are only the famous cases. Mass delusions are influencing every one of us all the time. Until the spell is broken, you can’t tell you are in one. The examples that follow should be enough for you to see the pattern. Once you see how easily mass delusions start, and how confirmation bias can keep them fueled, you might start to recognize how often it is happening to you in your daily experience.

### SALEM WITCH TRIALS
Between 1692 and 1693, authorities executed twenty people in Salem, Massachusetts, for being witches. This is perhaps the most famous case of mass hysteria in American history. It all started when four adolescent girls started having fits that didn’t have an obvious cause.1 In this sort of situation, all it takes is one idiot to suggest witchcraft as the problem, and from that point on, confirmation bias does the rest. Once your brain filter is set to look for witches, all evidence fits into the “witch” frame.

### ORSON WELLES’S “THE WAR OF THE WORLDS”
In 1938 author Orson Welles broadcast a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells’s book The War of the Worlds. People who missed the introduction and tuned in late believed they were hearing a news report of an actual alien invasion of Earth.2

This is a rare case of a double mass delusion. The first mass delusion involved listeners misinterpreting the radio program as a news report and believing space aliens were attacking. But that “mass” delusion didn’t influence many people because the radio show had a small audience. The second mass delusion is that this story was exaggerated in the telling until the public believed it had been a mass delusion of national scale. I can confirm that when I was a child, I learned from my parents that the radio program fooled much of the country at the same time. That didn’t happen. The program had a small listener base, and anyone who heard the introduction knew it was presented as fiction.

### MCMARTIN PRESCHOOL TRIAL
In the 1980s, the operators of a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were arrested on charges of abusing 360 kids. The accused were found not guilty on all charges. Later we learned that investigators used an extremely suggestive form of questioning when interviewing the children. The kids made up all sorts of stories in response to how the questions were phrased. None of the stories were true.3

I learned in hypnosis class that kids are more suggestible than adults. Anyone with my kind of training would have seen this situation for what it was. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to do the same.

### TULIP MANIA
In 1637 the Dutch became so enamored with tulips, a flower that was new to them, that they bid up the price of tulip bulbs (the part you plant) to about ten times the annual income of a skilled worker.4 Everyone understood that the plants were not intrinsically valuable. But as long as people believed the next sucker would buy a bulb for more than the last sucker paid, the price continued to climb. Like all financial bubbles, eventually it popped.

On top of our mass delusions, we also have junk science that is too often masquerading as the real thing. To the extent that people can’t tell the difference, that too is a source of mass delusion.

In the 2-D view of the world, mass delusions are rare and newsworthy. But to trained persuaders in the third dimension, mass delusions are the norm. They are everywhere, and they influence every person. This difference in training and experience can explain why people disagree on some of the big issues of the day.

For example, consider the case of global warming. People from the 2-D world assume mass delusions are rare, and they apply that assumption to every topic. So when they notice that most scientists are on the same side, that observation is persuasive to them. A reasonable person wants to be on the same side with the smartest people who understand the topic. That makes sense, right?

But people who live in the 3-D world, where persuasion rules, can often have a different view of climate change because we see mass delusions (even among experts) as normal and routine. My starting bias for this topic is that the scientists could easily be wrong about the horrors of climate change, even in the context of repeated experiments and peer review. Whenever you see a situation with complicated prediction models, you also have lots of room for bias to masquerade as reason. Just tweak the assumptions and you can get any outcome you want.

Now add to that situation the fact that scientists who oppose the climate change consensus have a high degree of career and reputation risk. That’s the perfect setup for a mass delusion. You only need these two conditions:

1. Complicated prediction models with lots of assumptions
1. Financial and psychological pressure to agree with the consensus
   
In the 2-D world, the scientific method and peer review squeeze out the bias over time. But in the 3-D world, the scientific method can’t detect bias when nearly everyone including the peer reviewers shares the same mass delusion.

I’m not a scientist, and I have no way to validate the accuracy of the climate model predictions. But if the majority of experts on this topic turn out to be having a mass hallucination, I would consider that an ordinary situation. In my reality, this would be routine, if not expected, whenever there are complicated prediction models involved. That’s because I see the world as bristling with mass delusions. I don’t see mass delusions as rare.

When nonscientists take sides with climate scientists, they often think they are being supportive of science. The reality is that the nonscientists are not involved in science, or anything like it. They are taking the word of scientists. In the 2-D world, that makes perfect sense, because it seems as if thousands of experts can’t be wrong. But in the 3-D world, I accept that the experts could be right, and perhaps they are, but it would be normal and natural in my experience if the vast majority of climate scientists were experiencing a shared hallucination.

To be clear, I am not saying the majority of scientists are wrong about climate science. I’m making the narrow point that it would be normal and natural for that group of people to be experiencing a mass hallucination that is consistent with their financial and psychological incentives. The scientific method and the peer-review process wouldn’t necessarily catch a mass delusion during any specific window of time. With science, you never know if you are halfway to the truth or already there. Sometimes it looks the same.

Climate science is a polarizing topic (ironically). So let me just generalize the point to say that compared with the average citizen, trained persuaders are less impressed by experts.

To put it another way, if an ordinary idiot doubts a scientific truth, the most likely explanation for that situation is that the idiot is wrong. But if a trained persuader calls BS on a scientific truth, pay attention.

Do you remember when citizen Trump once tweeted that climate change was a hoax for the benefit of China? It sounded crazy to most of the world. Then we learned that the centerpiece of politics around climate change—the Paris climate accord—was hugely expensive for the United States and almost entirely useless for lowering temperatures. (Experts agree on both points now.) The accord was a good deal for China, in the sense that it would impede its biggest business rival, the United States, while costing China nothing for years. You could say Trump was wrong to call climate change a hoax. But in the context of Trump’s normal hyperbole, it wasn’t as wrong as the public’s mass delusion believed it to be at the time.

I’ll concede that citizen Trump did not understand the science of climate change. That’s true of most of us. But he still detected a fraud from a distance.

It wasn’t luck.

## WHEN REALITY BIFURCATED
When the presidential election of 2016 was over, reality split into two movies. Trump supporters believed that they had elected a competent populist to “drain the swamp” and make America great again. Their preferred media sources agreed. But anti-Trumpers had been force-fed, by both the mainstream media and Clinton’s campaign, a fire hose of persuasion that said Trump was the next Hitler. In effect, the Trump supporters and the anti-Trumpers woke up in different movies. One movie is a disaster movie and the other is an inspirational story.

The fascinating thing about this situation is each of us can operate in the world and do the things we need to do to survive. You and I can both go shopping, both drive cars, both have jobs and friends. Living in completely different realities is our normal way of living. We usually don’t see it so starkly as we did the week after the election.

The two-movie split in our reality wouldn’t have happened if Clinton had won, as most experts expected. In that scenario, everyone would simply be living in a world that was a lot like the one they were already in. But Trump’s unexpected win created a persuasion bomb that no one knew how to defuse. The anti-Trumpers were locked into their Hitler movie, and confirmation bias would keep them there. It was a terrible situation for a country. And it was an enormous challenge for Trump, the Master Persuader.

> PERSUASION TIP 8
> People are more influenced by the direction of things than the current state of things.

It turns out Trump was up to the challenge. The solution to the Hitler movie is to act non-Hitlerish in public until people can no longer maintain the Hitler illusion and it falls apart. And that’s how Trump and his running mate Pence played it. They quickly moderated some of their more extreme campaign positions so they looked like they were heading away from Hitler mode, not toward it. People are more influenced by the direction of things than the current state. So Trump changed the direction.

Trump signaled his direction away from authoritarian rule in several high-profile ways.

1. President Trump’s most notable change involved scaling back his deportation plans by focusing on undocumented immigrants who committed serious crimes after entering the country.
1. Trump also worked with Congress and the judicial system (like an ordinary politician) trying to get an immigration ban on several countries believed to be high risk in terms of future terrorist attacks. By failing on his initial attempts, and working within the system, he looked nothing like a “strongman” leader.
1. Trump dropped support for waterboarding, and he stopped talking about going after the families of terrorists.
1. Trump ordered a fifty-nine-Tomahawk-missile attack on a Syrian air base as a response to allegations that Syria used chemical weapons. Even Trump’s critics called it measured and “presidential.”

Trump’s critics strained to maintain their framing of the president as a dictator, but his actions no longer provided the high-quality ammunition that his preelection provocations did. And that allowed the Trump-is-Hitler illusion to begin the process of evaporating. By the time you read this book, some of the events I mentioned might look different. But you can see that Trump got the direction right. He was clearly trending away from the Hitler label and toward something that looks more like a regular president.

Trump couldn’t fully erase the Hitler illusion until he had another “movie” to replace it in people’s heads. Trump created the replacement movie (in part) by using a common business persuasion strategy that I call the new-CEO move. Here’s how I described it in my blog after President-elect Trump and VP-elect Pence claimed credit for keeping Ford and Carrier jobs in this country.

::: tip Posted December 1, 2016

So what does a Master Persuader do when he needs to create a good first impression to last for years? He looks around for any opportunity that is visible, memorable, newsworthy, true to his brand, and easy to change.

Enter Ford.

Enter Carrier.

Trump and Pence recognized these openings and took them. Political writers will interpret this situation as routine credit grabbing and exaggerated claims. But business writers will recognize Trump’s strategy as what I will call the new-CEO move. Smart CEOs try to create visible victories within days of taking the job, to set the tone. It’s all about the psychology.

If you are looking at Trump’s claims of success with Ford and Carrier in terms of technical accuracy and impact on the economy, you will be underwhelmed. But if you view it through a business filter and understand that psychology is the point of the exercise, you’re seeing one of the best new-CEO moves you will ever see.

I’ll say this again because it’s important. We’re all watching closely to see if President-elect Trump has the skill to be president. And while you watch, Trump and Pence are pulling off one of the most skillfully executed new-CEO moves you will ever see. Remember what I taught you in the past year: Facts don’t matter. What matters is how you feel. And when you watch Trump and Pence fight and scratch to keep jobs in this country, it changes how you will feel about them for their entire term. This is a big win for Trump/Pence disguised as a small win.

The political press will dismiss Ford and Carrier with fact-checking. But the stock market will be smarter. Experienced businesspeople recognize the new-CEO move and they know how powerful and important it is.

If you are worried about Trump’s talent for leadership, this should help set your mind at ease. He hasn’t even started the job and he’s already performing better than any past president in the same phase.
:::

The best leaders are the ones who understand human psychology and use that knowledge to address the public’s top priorities. For example, investors need optimism about the future to justify investments, and Trump brought optimism about the economy, punctuated by his new-CEO move.

Foreign adversaries need to know America is decisive and willing to use force if needed, and Trump brought that as well. Soon after becoming president, Trump ordered a Tomahawk-missile attack on Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. You might say that was a new-CEO move specific to the job of commander in chief.

See the pattern?

Trump got the big stuff right while his perma-critics were left to complain about his low approval ratings, his “risky” style, his strongman vibe, his Twitter habits, and maybe some kind of sketchy Russian connection—that sort of thing.

Keep an eye out for the new-CEO move at your workplace, and sometimes in government. When you see it executed right, optimism is warranted. Even if the critics miss the show.


## THE MAKING OF A HYPNOTIST
Hypnosis is a special form of persuasion, generally involving one hypnotist guiding one patient (or subject) toward some sort of personal improvement. You don’t need to be a trained hypnotist to be persuasive, but understanding what hypnosis can and cannot do is extraordinarily valuable. It can change your entire worldview. That’s what happened to me when I trained to be a hypnotist. I once believed people use facts and reason to make decisions. When I disagreed with people, I assumed it was because I had different facts or better reasons.

That was an illusion.

The reality one learns while practicing hypnosis is that we make our decisions first—for irrational reasons—and we rationalize them later as having something to do with facts and reason. If you believe humans are fundamentally rational, you will have a hard time learning to be a hypnotist because hypnotists rely on our irrational brain wiring to persuade. The most effective politicians do the same. In this chapter I’ll give you some background on hypnosis to show you how easily the human mind can be rewired by a skilled operator. This background will help you understand Trump’s election victory, and it might explain a lot of other mysteries in your personal and professional life.

I’ve been interested in hypnosis since I was a child. My family doctor was a hypnotist, and he hypnotized my mother to eliminate her pain when she gave birth to my sister. My mother said that although she was hypnotized—or so she claimed—she was conscious of the entire birth process and felt no discomfort. And that was without pain meds, at least according to my mom.

In hindsight it’s not clear how much of that story was true. One of the things I’ve learned as a lifelong student of persuasion is that false memories are common. And sometimes adults don’t tell the truth. My mother was a straight shooter, so I doubt she made up the story. But I can’t be sure she remembered everything accurately, such as whether or not someone actually gave her pain meds and she forgot that part.

In any event, I bought into my mother’s story, and I vowed to someday learn this thing called hypnosis. I hoped that learning hypnosis would imbue me with some sort of superpower.

It turns out I was right.

When I was in my midtwenties, living in San Francisco, I signed up for an evening class at the Clement School of Hypnosis. (It no longer exists.) And by “school” I mean there were about ten students learning from one professional hypnotist. If I recall, we met twice a week for about ten weeks, or something along those lines. The instructor hypnotized the class a number of times so we could experience hypnosis from the receiving side. After he taught us enough technique, we practiced on one another and—for homework—we hypnotized willing strangers and reported back on our progress.

> PERSUASION TIP 9
> Display confidence (either real or faked) to improve your persuasiveness. You have to believe yourself, or at least appear as if you do, in order to get anyone else to believe.

I know you want me to teach you how to be a hypnotist. But you can’t learn it from a book. Some skills require a lot of in-person practice, and this is one of them. Part of the process of learning hypnosis involves building confidence in your skills until your subjects can sense it by your demeanor. That confidence is a key ingredient to making hypnosis work. You can build up to that confidence in a class setting, over time, in a way that I doubt anyone can get from a book. If you try a method from a book and it doesn’t work on the first try, you’ll probably dismiss the book as a scam and stop trying. Learning hypnosis from a book might be possible, but I’ve never heard of anyone pulling it off.

Hypnosis is largely an observational skill. Half of the process involves looking for microchanges in the subject so you can determine whether or not the approach you are using is having the effect you want. You can’t get good at an observational skill without lots of practice. A subject under hypnosis has a distinctive look that I doubt I could describe in words, and I’m good at describing things in words. But the look of a hypnotized subject is unmistakable once you have seen it often enough. You can’t get that sort of experience from a book. You have to observe a lot of people under hypnosis to recognize it.

> PERSUASION TIP 10
> Persuasion is strongest when the messenger is credible.

I found it easy to get volunteers for hypnosis by saying I was enrolled in a hypnosis class. I doubt I could have recruited volunteers so easily by saying I was reading a book about hypnosis. The class gave me some credibility with strangers, and a hypnotist in training needs a lot of strangers to practice on. One of the things we learned in class is that hypnotizing friends and family doesn’t work well because you have too much history and baggage to overcome. People close to you will have trouble getting into the mind-set that you suddenly have a magical new skill. Strangers are more likely to grant you the assumption of credibility, even if you are only a student of hypnosis. And you need the credibility for the hypnosis to work.

One of the most confusing things about hypnosis is that the things you think it can do, it probably can’t. But the things you didn’t know it could do—such as predicting presidential outcomes—are mind-boggling.

I spoke to a number of other trained persuaders during the election. The following observation is purely anecdotal, but I don’t recall any trained persuaders thinking Clinton was a lock to win. Most predicted an outright Trump win, or at least a surprisingly close race.

You’ve probably heard of people using hypnosis to lose weight or to stop smoking cigarettes. Hypnosis works for those methods about as well as other nonmedical methods—and by that I mean it usually doesn’t work. People who go on diets usually fail no matter what method they use. People who try to stop smoking also fail more often than not. Hypnosis gets you about the same poor result as other nonmedical methods.

The reason hypnosis is not a powerful tool for losing weight or quitting smoking is almost humorously simple: You don’t want to eat less and you don’t want to stop smoking. Smokers and overeaters like both of those things. That’s the whole problem. If people didn’t enjoy eating and smoking, they wouldn’t be doing those things. And hypnosis is only good for getting you what you do want. If any part of your mind doesn’t fully embrace the change you want, hypnosis might be the wrong tool.

But hypnosis can work well in situations where the subject has no objection to modifying an old behavior. For example, let’s say you want to overcome a specific type of fear. In those cases, the subject has zero desire to keep the fear. The fear provides no pleasure or other benefit. Hypnosis can work well in those situations. But you are still fighting against some sort of irrational wiring in the subject’s mind, so success is not guaranteed with hypnosis. Every brain is different, and every hypnotist is different.

The best situation for hypnosis is when there is no precondition to overcome. Preconditions in this context might include an irrational fear, a love of eating junk food, or an addiction to smoking. Those cases are hard because some part of your mind wants to keep the old behavior.

But sometimes you are working toward a change that has no precondition to overcome, and that’s the best situation. For example, if you were already a well-adjusted person and you wanted to learn how to relax more effectively, hypnosis would be a great tool. In this case, there is no objection to relaxing—the person just doesn’t have the tools to do it well. Hypnosis can provide the right tools.

It might also surprise you that a hypnotist can sometimes induce massive orgasms in a willing subject just by choosing the right words in a private setting. But that won’t work unless the hypnotist and the subject have some sort of chemistry and a shared desire for that outcome. I know this is possible only because a coworker asked me about it while I was in hypnosis school. At the time, I didn’t know if such a thing was possible. But I needed the practice, and she volunteered to be my test subject, so I gave it a try. After about one hour of hypnosis and twenty or so screaming orgasms—no touching involved—she declared the experiment a success. I later learned that the experiment is repeatable with the right kind of subject. That’s what I mean by “mind-boggling” power. The point of the story is that hypnosis is a powerful tool when it is working in the same direction as people’s existing urges.

You’ll be happy to know that hypnosis can’t make people do things they know to be wrong in their waking state. Or at least there are no credible stories of that happening. That makes sense to anyone who has ever been hypnotized. A hypnotized person is actually conscious and aware but deeply relaxed. They can open their eyes and walk out the door at any time.

The public has a distorted impression of hypnosis because of movies. In a movie you can hypnotize someone to become an assassin. In real life, that’s not possible. In the movies you often see the hypnotist waving a watch or some other pendant-type object and telling you to stare at it. No trained hypnotist does that in real life. It doesn’t have a purpose.

By now you are wondering if stage hypnosis is real or just a trick. Stage hypnotists seem to make people do embarrassing things in public, and that would appear to violate what I just said about people not doing things while under hypnosis that they would object to if awake. In the case of stage hypnosis, there is a magic trick involved on top of the hypnosis. The magic trick is that you assume the people onstage think the way you think. If you would be embarrassed doing what you see them doing, you assume they feel the same. But they don’t. In any crowd of a hundred people it is easy to find several who are good subjects for hypnosis and also not easily embarrassed by public displays of silliness. The illusion for the audience is that the subjects onstage are so deeply under the hypnotist’s spell that they are acting against their own self-interest by embarrassing themselves in public. The secret to the illusion is that the only people who will go onstage in that situation are the ones who know they won’t be bothered by the experience.

Further deepening the stage-hypnosis illusion is the fact that many of the subjects are introverts and wallflowers in normal life. But keep in mind that many famous performers are introverts in person and yet have no trouble performing to large crowds. People come in all types. If the stage hypnotist has a large enough audience, you can be sure there are some people who will be comfortable doing silly things onstage. Yes, the subjects are hypnotized. But that alone wouldn’t be enough to make an unwilling person do embarrassing things in public. The willingness has to be there from the start.

I used a hypnosis technique in the paragraph before last that starts with “By now you are wondering . . .” The hypnosis technique involves demonstrating that I know what you are thinking at the moment you are thinking it. If I guess right, this creates a little bond between the author and the reader because it feels like I know you as well as I might know a friend. It’s like I’m in your head. That type of personal connection makes whatever I write seem more interesting to you because you naturally care more about a friend than a stranger.

Hypnotists use the same method to create a quick connection with the subject. If I tell you what you are thinking at the exact moment you are thinking it, I can create the illusion that our minds are somehow connected. And once connected, and comfortable with the connection, the subject is more likely to let the hypnotist later operate the controls.

> PERSUASION TIP 11
> Guess what people are thinking—at the very moment they think it—and call it out. If you are right, the subject bonds to you for being like-minded.

In my example above, I know from years of experience that when I start to describe hypnosis, it almost always triggers a specific question: “Is stage hypnosis real?” A nonpersuader might provide the answer when asked. But as a trained persuader, I take it one step further and tell you directly that I know that question is in your head at the moment that it is. If the question is not in your head, you won’t even notice that I said it was. You will see my statement as nothing but an introduction to the point. But if I accurately guess that you have curiosity about stage hypnosis, and I answer your unspoken thought at the moment you have it, we form a mental bond that helps you enjoy my writing more. I use that technique to make my writing more personal and powerful. If my writing style seems different from the norm, that’s one reason why.

For more tips on writing, I include in appendix B my brief viral blog post on how to be a better writer.

### WHO CAN BE HYPNOTIZED?
I often hear people say they “can’t be hypnotized” because they tried it once and nothing happened. In my experience—which happens to match what I learned in hypnosis class—an experienced hypnotist can hypnotize anyone, so long as the subject is willing. Where the confusion comes in is that only about 20 percent of the public can experience what hypnotists sometimes call “the phenomena.” The term describes any situation in which the subject experiences a full-blown illusion, such as seeing something that isn’t there or feeling something that isn’t real. My mother’s experience of feeling no pain during childbirth falls into that category.

But the 80 percent of the public who can’t experience the phenomena can still get tremendous benefits from hypnosis. If you want to learn how to relax, how to be comfortable in a particular situation, or how to perform better at something, the only requirement is that you be willing to be hypnotized. That’s good enough for most purposes.

Nonhypnotists are often under the impression that the best subjects for hypnosis are gullible, dumb, or somehow weak-minded. We learned in hypnosis class that there is no personality trait that predicts how easily someone can be hypnotized. Anecdotally, smart people seem to be the easiest to hypnotize. My hypnosis instructor said he thought that was the case, based on experience, and I’ve noticed the same thing. If there is a correlation with intelligence, it probably has to do with the fact that smart people are less concerned that the hypnotist will turn them into an assassin or a sex slave because they know that isn’t a real risk. But as a general rule, there is no way to deduce from a person’s intelligence or personality whether that person will be an especially good subject for hypnosis. A trained hypnotist can tell rather quickly how good a subject will be as soon as the process starts, just by watching how the body reacts to suggestions. But there is generally no way to know ahead of time how good a subject will be. And the subjects themselves have no way to know either, but they usually think they do. That’s an illusion caused by their egos. People who view themselves as strong willed also imagine they can’t be hypnotized. Submissive personality types often assume they will be good subjects for hypnosis. But those variables are not predictive. They just feel as if they should be.

### HYPNOSIS SUPERPOWERS
When I signed up for hypnosis class, I assumed I would use the skill I learned only to perform hypnosis on willing subjects. But it turns out that the biggest benefit of learning hypnosis is what it does to your worldview, and how it influences all of your decisions from that point on. Once you see with your own eyes the power of persuasion, and how easily people can be reprogrammed, it changes everything you do.

> PERSUASION TIP 12
> If you want the audience to embrace your content, leave out any detail that is both unimportant and would give people a reason to think, That’s not me. Design into your content enough blank spaces so people can fill them in with whatever makes them happiest.

For example, if you are familiar with my Dilbert comic strip, you might know that Dilbert has no last name. His boss has no name at all. You don’t know the name of Dilbert’s company or what industry it is in. You also don’t know its location. All of that omission is intentional. It is a trick I learned from hypnosis class. I leave out any details that would cause readers to feel they are different from the characters in the comic. If Dilbert had a last name, it might tell you something about his ancestry. If you knew for sure that Dilbert’s background differed from your own in some big way, it could be an irrational trigger to make you feel less connected. Likewise, if you knew Dilbert’s company was in a specific industry that was different from yours, you might feel less connected. By intentionally omitting those details in the design of the Dilbert comic, I make it easier for people to think, Dilbert’s job is just like mine.

#### Lie Detection
An unexpected benefit of learning hypnosis is that I can detect lies with freaky accuracy. Liars usually have “tells,” or clues to signal deception. Some of the tells are in the form of body language and facial microchanges—the same things that a hypnotist learns to detect. Liars also use predictable patterns of language that you can pick up once you know what to look for.

For example, if you accuse an innocent person of a crime, the accused generally responds by immediately denying the accusation and asking what is wrong with you for even asking. But the first reaction of guilty people, usually, is to ask what evidence you have. They need to know what you know so they can either double down on the lie or confess. Liars confess only if the evidence against them is airtight.

#### Romance
You can’t make someone love you if the chemistry isn’t there. Hypnosis isn’t that kind of power. But if you have natural chemistry with a person and simply want things to go as well as possible, a working knowledge of hypnosis is immensely useful.

Here I’m not talking about a formal induction, in which a hypnotist puts a subject in a so-called trance state. I’m talking only about the knowledge of human nature that you absorb by studying hypnosis. Once you understand people to be irrational 90 percent of the time, you can give up on your old method of using reason and logic to make someone love you. Love, romance, and sex are fundamentally irrational human behaviors, and it helps to see them that way.

For example, a man who thinks humans are rational creatures might try to attract a woman by being extra nice. That seems reasonable because people like nice people more than they like mean people. But seduction-wise, niceness is boring, and nice people are a dime a dozen. Niceness can get you only so far.

A far better seduction strategy would involve participating in any kind of coed group activities at which you happen to excel. When you display any kind of talent, it triggers other humans to want to mate with you. We’re biologically hardwired to be attracted to anything that helps the gene pool, and talent is a signal for valuable genes. So instead of being nice, focus on being talented, or attractive, or smart, or muscular, or something that suggests you have good genes.

A common misconception is that because nice guys seem to finish last and jerky guys seem to get the women, being a jerk must have some sort of seduction advantage. It doesn’t. That’s an illusion caused by the fact that people who have other advantages—such as wealth or beauty—have the freedom to act like jerks because they can attract mates no matter what. If you don’t understand what motivates people at a deep level, you might be fooled by your observation that jerks often do well in romance. If being mean were useful to getting sex, you would see ugly people doing it more often with great success. But keep your eyes open and you’ll notice that attractive people can get away with being mean, and ugly people can’t. Attractiveness is the key correlation.

The exception to this rule is something called “negging” in the language of so-called pickup artists. The idea is to say something subversively negative (negging)—but not too negative—to a woman to make her less confident. For example, the man might walk up to the woman and ask, “Did you just get your hair done?” Notice that it isn’t a compliment and it isn’t an insult. But the woman will register it as a criticism because there was no compliment appended to the question. The normal structure of that question would be “Did you do something with your hair today? It looks great.” When you put the compliment in the question, you’re using the “nice” strategy that won’t get you far. When you leave out the compliment and ask if the hair is different today, it suggests that perhaps you are not crazy about it. That unspoken put-down causes some women (not all, obviously) to reframe their situation as a confident male talking to a woman with some unspoken defect. That creates the illusion—or at least the possibility—that the man is a higher social rank. The perceived difference in social rank—illusion though it is—triggers attraction in the woman in this example because we are biologically wired to believe that people of higher rank probably have some sort of genetic advantage that got them there. And we want to mate with those people to pass those genes to the kids.

Personally, I have never used negging to attract a woman. By the time I learned of the concept, I was already rich and successful, so I had enough perceived status that I didn’t need any tricks. You can reach your own conclusions about the ethics of negging. I’m only including it here for education and completeness.

Communicating
After taking the hypnosis class, I became interested in the broader field of persuasion in the normal world. By then I was working at a large bank that encouraged employees to take a variety of in-house classes. I took classes in negotiating, selling, marketing, listening skills, business writing, leadership, public speaking, and more. When you communicate, you are usually trying to persuade, even if you don’t see it that way. You might be trying to make someone laugh, persuade someone to buy, cause someone to fall in love or to stay in love. You might be trying to convey talent or knowledge to a professional contact. At a minimum, most communication involves trying to influence people’s opinion of you, even if the content of your message is neutral. So persuasion and communication overlap quite a bit. If you learn only the tools of communication—the rules of grammar, for example—and you don’t learn persuasion, your writing will be weak or, worse, you will make an enormous persuasion mistake and not know it.

A good example of an enormous persuasion mistake happened during the Republican primary debate on September 16, 2015, in Simi Valley, California. Candidate Carly Fiorina tried to cut through the crowded field by graphically describing an alleged video of an abortion that went wrong. (I’m intentionally not describing it here. You’ll see why.) When I watched Fiorina’s bold move to capture the nation’s attention on a key topic for the Republican base, I publicly predicted that she had “self-immolated.” I called it the worst persuasion move you are likely to see in any realm. CNN’s poll put Fiorina at 15 percent during the week of the debate. As I predicted, she dropped to 4 percent one month later and was soon out of the race.1

If you are not a student of persuasion, you might think Fiorina’s strategy was bold and clever. It guaranteed free attention from both the mainstream media and social media. And it positioned her as the strongest voice on a key election topic. It was unforgettable, and it matched the emotions of the Republican base. All of that sounds good.

But here’s what she got wrong. And this is more wrong than anything you are likely to see in any realm of life, much less politics: Fiorina paired her brand with a dead baby.

I knew voters wouldn’t want to think about Fiorina’s horrible story of a dead baby for one second longer than they needed to. I doubt anyone consciously interpreted the situation as I describe it. But humans don’t make political decisions for rational reasons anyway. The Persuasion Filter says Fiorina lost support because she polluted her brand beyond redemption by associating it with the most horrible image one could ever imagine, on live television. If you asked the voters who abandoned Fiorina to give reasons for their switch, they would probably tell you—and they would believe it to be true—that they switched candidates for rational reasons. But according to the Persuasion Filter, they would be rationalizing their irrational decisions without knowing it.

### FINDING A HYPNOSIS SCHOOL
By now some of you are wondering how you can find a hypnosis school of your own. (See how I anticipated your question, or at least some people’s question?) Unfortunately, I can’t help you on this question because I have experience with only one hypnosis school and it no longer exists. If you find a hypnosis school locally, be sure to ask for references from past students. But be skeptical of the references for two reasons:

The school will connect you only with students they know will say good things.

A good hypnotist could give students the impression they got more value than they did.

But don’t worry too much about that second point. You wouldn’t want to learn hypnosis from an instructor who couldn’t persuade his own class to give him good reviews.
