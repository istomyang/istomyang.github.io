# PART 3 HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES WHAT OTHERS CAN’T

## THE TIME OF KINGS
The following story appeared in my blog on September 4, 2015. I wrote it to make a point about the power of persuasion throughout history. I took some creative license with the historical details, but I stand behind the persuasion points.

This is just for fun, and to prime you for the chapters to come. Take note of how it makes you feel.

Everything that follows is true.

As far as I know.

Centuries ago, in the time of kings, a young autodidact discovered the linguistic interface to the human mind. Some say he was the first wizard. This we cannot know for sure.

The source of the wizard’s power was a simple discovery. He learned that when he described to people better versions of themselves, they automatically rewired their minds to rise to his description. At first the wizard used his method to control one person at a time. Before long, he learned how to move entire crowds.

And then he was dangerous.

News of the wizard’s power spread across the kingdom. The king dispatched his soldiers to hunt down the wizard and kill him before the wizard’s power grew to rival his own.

But it was too late.

The wizard had anticipated his own death. Working feverishly, the wizard managed to condense all he had learned into four words. But there was a risk of leaving those four words and their immense power in the wrong hands after the wizard’s death. The world was not ready.

The wizard wrote his four words on scrolls and ordered his people to hide them in a maze of less important words. The wizard hoped that someday a new wizard would find the hidden words and unpack their meaning. And he hoped that by then the world would be ready for such power.

Centuries passed. The words survived, but no wizard came to unlock their true meaning. Many pretenders tried. Wars were fought in an effort to understand the four words and the decoy words surrounding them. It was futile. The words were hidden too well, in plain sight, as wizards do.

Hundreds of years later, in another kingdom, five wizards rose. All of them started life as bright, curious autodidacts. Individually, each of them decoded the hidden message from the original wizard and unlocked the power of the four words.

History does not tell us why five wizards suddenly rose at once, and in the same kingdom. We know only that it happened.

Armed with the power of the four words from the original wizard, each of the wizards amassed fame and power. And each started to notice the unusual successes of the others.

One of the wizards was deeply unattractive. Yet he had the power to seduce any woman.

That is a tell. (A signal.)

One wizard lived like a rich man despite having no net wealth.

That is a tell.

One wizard could inspire men to great acts, using words alone.

That is a tell.

The wizards met one another and shared their secrets. They were good people, by the standards of the day, but their powers caught the attention of the king. Men with so much power were a risk to the throne. So the king raised an army to move against the five wizards.

The five wizards heard of the king’s plan and combined forces to defend against his army. The ugly wizard was dispatched to seduce the king of another great power and persuade him to fight on their side. The wizard succeeded. But it wasn’t enough.

Another wizard used his powers to raise an army of passionate men who would fight and die for the wizards’ cause.

The remaining wizards manipulated the opinions of civilians and raised money to support the war.

The wizards knew their odds of survival were low. So they followed the example of the original wizard and created a linguistic maze to hide their secrets until future wizards could unlock their power.

The five wizards condensed the original wizard’s four-word linguistic code down to three new words that were a better fit for the times. And they buried the three words in a dense document where none but a future wizard would find them.

Against all odds, the five wizards and their legions of followers prevailed in a long, bloody conflict against the king’s forces. After the war, the wizards lived to very old ages, as wizards sometimes can, and passed peacefully.

The words created by the five wizards changed the world in their time and continue to be the most important code in the operating system of human beings. Those three words have toppled dictators, moved mountains, and fed the hungry.

Perhaps someday a future wizard will improve on the code left behind by the five wizards. But I doubt it, because I believe you will never see three more beautiful or powerful words.

Turn the page to see the three words.

“We the People . . .”

The original wizard’s four-word code still survives as well. And it has escaped its linguistic maze to join less important words from popular culture. But no matter how many words you put around the original four, none can change its meaning. The four words, in their time, told us of our better selves.

The four words are on the following page.

“Turn the other cheek.”

## PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TALENT STACK

In my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, I talk about the concept of a talent stack. A talent stack is a collection of skills that work well together and make the person with those skills unique and valuable. For example, a computer programmer who also knows how to do good user interface design would be more valuable than one who does not. The power of the talent stack idea is that you can intelligently combine ordinary talents together to create extraordinary value. The key concept here is that the talents in the stack work well with one another. If you acquire the right combination of ordinary talents, you don’t need to be the world’s best at any of them.

For example, I am not a great artist, and I have never taken a traditional class in writing. I’m not the funniest person in my social circle, and I’m not a great business mind either. But few people in the world have a complete talent stack as valuable as mine. By being good enough in each of those individual talents, I can be a famous syndicated cartoonist and enjoy an ideal career. Whenever you see people succeeding beyond your expectations, look for the existence of a well-engineered talent stack.

Case in point: Few people thought Donald Trump would win the presidency in 2016. Part of the reason for that wrongness is that people don’t understand the power of persuasion. Trump is the best persuader I’ve ever seen. A big reason for his persuasion effectiveness is that he has accumulated a remarkable talent stack. If you were to look at any one of his talents, you would not be impressed. And that’s what fooled observers when they were evaluating his chances. They saw a candidate who was not extraordinarily good at anything in particular. He wasn’t the smartest person in the race. He wasn’t the most experienced. He wasn’t the best communicator (in traditional terms.) For more than half of the country, he wasn’t even likable. But it didn’t matter. What he did have is one of the best talent stacks you will ever see. The combination of his skills is truly special. Let’s take a look at President Trump’s talent stack.

Publicity: Donald Trump understands the value of publicity, and he knows how to get it. He has spent decades creating controversies and attracting attention to himself and the Trump brand. He isn’t the best publicity expert in the world, but most people would agree he’s very good.

Reputation: Trump has carefully nurtured a reputation as a businessperson who knows how to get things done. His reputation serves him well whenever he enters a new field. His track record makes people feel optimistic about his chances, and that gives him an advantage. People expect him to do well in the future because he has done well in the past. This sort of reputation doesn’t happen on its own. Trump has used his skill to create that reputation. You might call it “branding.”

Strategy: Trump probably isn’t the best strategic thinker in the world. But obviously he is good at making strategic decisions. We saw lots of examples during the election, including his decision to use social media more than a traditional advertising approach. He also campaigned more than Hillary Clinton in the swing states that ended up making all the difference. In hindsight, his strategy was solid.

Negotiating: Trump literally wrote the book on negotiating, called The Art of the Deal. Actually, his coauthor, Tony Schwartz, wrote most of it. But obviously it reflected Trump’s negotiating preferences.

Persuasion: Trump is the best persuader I have ever seen. But much of that effectiveness is related to his total talent stack. His mastery of the tools of persuasion is fairly ordinary. You will learn most of those tools in this book.

Public speaking: Trump is an entertaining and provocative public speaker, but no one would say he is the world’s best orator. He’s far better than average, and that’s good enough for the talent stack.

Sense of humor: Trump has a good sense of humor, and that’s a powerful tool of persuasion. A sense of humor makes people like you, and it makes you look smarter. Trump isn’t as funny as professional humorists, but he’s funny enough.

Quick on his feet: It’s not easy to look relaxed and mentally sharp in public, when all eyes are on you. But it is something you can learn. Trump probably has some natural talent and mental quickness, but when you add to that all of his practice at being a public figure, it’s a strong talent.

Thick skinned: Trump’s critics like to label him “thin-skinned” because he often attacks his critics. But counterattacking is good persuasion. It tells people that being his friend is better than being his critic. So while Trump looks thin-skinned on the 2-D checkerboard, he’s actually super hardened against criticism because he has endured a lifetime of it. When he ran for president, he had to know the abuse would be ten times worse than anything he had experienced before then. You don’t sign up for that kind of abuse unless you know you can handle the shaming. Evidently, Trump can. It’s a valuable skill, and one you can learn.

High energy: The best persuaders bring the most energy to the topic. Our brains interpret high energy as competence and leadership (even when it isn’t). Trump has a natural high energy, and he never lets you forget it.

Size and appearance: Trump is tall, and we humans are primed—by biology and our sexist society—to see tall male figures as leaders. Trump also has a distinctive look, with his stern face and his unusual haircut. His physicality makes him more persuasive both because of his size and because you can’t stop looking at his hair. The things you remember and think about the most rise in importance in your mind. One look at Trump in his business suit, with his height, his stern expression, and his unusual haircut, tells you he’s important. And Trump knows branding, so he never let us see him in casual clothing during the campaign for president.

Smart: As far as I can tell, Trump is far smarter than the average citizen. On top of that, he has deep experience across a number of different fields, so his intelligence is well rounded.

Trump’s talent stack is so strong that I believe he could make almost any basket of policies sound good to the public. I will go so far as to say that Trump could have run as a Democrat, embraced Bernie Sanders’s entire platform, and won the election that way.

The popular interpretation of how Trump won is that he understood the American people and devised policies that they wanted. My filter says the opposite. It says Trump convinced the public that his policies were the ones they should care about the most. And so they did. Obviously every voter is different, and one variable doesn’t explain an election. But my point is that persuasion was more important to the outcome than policies; we just perceive it to be the other way around.

Remember the two important elements of filters. They should make you happy, and they should do a good job of predicting the future. My filter predicted that Trump would soften his hard-line positions on a number of topics once he got into the general election. And he did. He even went so far as to reverse the key policy platform that got him nominated; he went from a position of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants to one in which he wants to deport only the ones who committed additional crimes after entering the country. At one point he said in an interview that women who get illegal abortions should be punished. The very next day he reversed his position. At one point he talked about punishing the families of terrorists, but that idea went away too.

If you think Trump’s policies got him elected, you have to explain why his positions substantially changed during the campaign and he still won. My filter explains it perfectly: Trump is so persuasive that policies didn’t matter. People voted for him even as his policies were murky and changing.

Another filter on the election says Trump won because he was the change candidate, and the change candidate has an advantage. But all of the Republican candidates represented a huge change from the Obama presidency. And prior to election day, few experts were predicting that Trump’s message of change would win.

I remind you that filters are not intended as windows to reality. Our brains did not evolve to understand reality. We’re all running different movies in our heads. All that matters is whether or not your filter keeps you happy and does a good job of predicting. In my experience, the Persuasion Filter does both of those things better than the alternatives.

## TRUMP’S ROSIE O’DONNELL MOMENT

As the election started getting traction in all of our minds, in the summer of 2015, I was experimenting with a new comic that featured a talking robot that never moves. He just reads the news. You can see in this comic that I had already noticed Trump’s successful use of persuasion that was confusing the public.


But I didn’t know how big a deal this was until what I now call the “Rosie O’Donnell Moment.” In the first Republican debate, on August 6, 2015, Megyn Kelly was moderating, and her first question to Trump should have ended his campaign on the spot. Only a few people in the world could have escaped her trap.

Kelly started to frame her dangerous question by saying, “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals . . .’”

Trump interrupted her by saying, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.”

Kelly finished her question and Trump responded with something about the problem of political correctness. But by then it didn’t matter. The Rosie O’Donnell reference sucked all the energy out of the room. It was a masterstroke of persuasion, timed perfectly, and executed in front of the world. When I saw it happen, I stood and walked toward the television (literally). I got goose bumps on my arm. This wasn’t normal. This was persuasion like I have never seen it performed in public. And in that moment, I saw the future unfold. Or I thought I did. It would take another year to be sure.

### HOW A MASTER PERSUADER MOVES ENERGY AND FOCUS
What made Trump’s Rosie O’Donnell response so masterful? For starters, consider how a normal, mainstream politician would have handled that trap. Most would have stated positive things about women and tried to change the subject. But that would be a failing strategy because there was so much public record of Trump’s past statements about women. It would just keep coming back.

Trump didn’t answer the way anyone expected. Trump used his weapons-grade persuasion and stacked together several techniques in a few sentences.

He created an emotion-triggering visual image (Rosie O’Donnell) that sucked all the attention from the question to the answer, and it wasn’t even a real answer. Our visual sense is the most persuasive of our five senses, so using a real person whom we recognize, and can imagine, is a great technique. He also picked a personality who was sure to trigger the emotions of his base. Republicans generally don’t like Rosie O’Donnell because of her outspoken liberal views.

Trump knew his Republican base has a strong negative reaction to O’Donnell, so he bonded with them on that point. This is the persuasion method known as pacing and leading. First you match your audience’s emotional condition to gain trust, and later you are in a position to lead them.

Trump also used the High-Ground Maneuver by taking the question out of the weeds of what he said in the past and up to the concept of how much it hurts the world to be bound by such silly political correctness. I’ll tell you more about the High-Ground Maneuver in its own chapter.

Trump guaranteed that all media attention would be on him because the Rosie O’Donnell quote is simply too interesting (and funny) to ignore. He sucked all the attention away from his sixteen competitors, rendering them uninteresting by comparison. That never changed.

None of this looked like luck to me. It was pitch-perfect technique, and it leveraged most of his persuasion talent stack, either directly or indirectly. Trump’s response to Kelly was funny, strategic, smart, memorable, visually persuasive, thick skinned (he didn’t seem bothered), provocative, and perfectly on brand. He converted Kelly’s attack into pure energy and then moved that energy where it suited him best. Normal people can’t do that. They wouldn’t even know how to start. When I saw it live, I realized it wasn’t business as usual. This was something special.

Inspired by what I saw at the debate, I wrote a blog post that became one of the most viral things I have written. The post was titled “Clown Genius.” It was my first step in reframing Trump as a Master Persuader. But I couldn’t directly jump into my main point. First I had to pace my readers—by agreeing with their way of thinking about candidate Trump. Once I established that trust and credibility, I started to lead them to a new way of viewing Trump’s capabilities.

Posted August 13, 2015

Like many of you, I have been entertained by the unstoppable clown car that is Donald Trump. On the surface, and several layers deep as well, Trump appears to be a narcissistic blowhard with inadequate credentials to lead a country.

The only problem with my analysis is that there is an eerie consistency to his success so far. Is there a method to it? Is there some sort of system at work under the hood?

That was the pacing part of my persuasion. Next I described Trump’s escape from the Rosie O’Donnell trap, as I have again in this chapter. I expected readers to agree with me that Trump did an unusually good job of escaping the trap. With that pacing behind me, I could lead my readers even further. Here is what I said.

You probably cringed when Trump kept saying his appearance gave Fox its biggest audience rating. That seemed totally off point for a politician, right? But see what happened.

Apparently Fox News chief Roger Ailes called Trump and made peace. And by that I mean Trump owns Fox News for the rest of the campaign, because his willingness to appear on their network will determine their financial fate. Bam, Trump owns Fox News and paid no money for it. See how this works? That’s what a strong brand gives you.

You probably also cringed when you heard Trump say Mexico was sending us their rapists and bad people. But if you have read this far, you now recognize that intentional exaggeration as an anchor, and a standard method of persuasion.

You will learn more about anchors later in this book.

On a recent TV interview, the host (I forget who) tried to label Trump a “whiner.” But instead of denying the label, Trump embraced it and said he was the best whiner of all time, and the country needs just that. That’s a psychological trick I call “taking the high ground.” The low ground in this case is the unimportant question of whether “whiner” is a fair label for Trump. But Trump cleverly took the high ground, embraced the label, and used it to set an anchor in your mind that he is the loudest voice for change. That’s some clown genius for you.

Persuasion isn’t the most predictive variable in every situation. Life is generally messy and complicated, with lots of powerful influences at play. But a presidential debate is not that messy and not that complicated. It is an artificial situation created for the purpose of limiting the number of variables. In that environment, a Master Persuader can rule, and a trained observer can see the technique as it happens. That’s what made the Rosie O’Donnell moment so compelling to me. Megyn Kelly challenged the greatest persuader of our generation to show his stuff to the world, free of external distractions and variables. And when he did, I saw the future unfold.

## THE PERSUASION STACK

Some forms of persuasion are stronger than others. Here I am talking about the broad categories of persuasion and not the specific tools. Below I rank for you the broad forms of persuasion by their relative power. The strongest are at the top. Notice that the emotional topics near the top are stronger than the more “rational” ones at the bottom. This is based entirely on my own experience as a persuader. The persuasion stack isn’t science, so I recommend viewing it as directional.

- Big fear
- Identity
- Smaller fear
- Aspirations
- Habit
- Analogies
- Reason
- Hypocrisy
- Word-thinking
  
As I will explain in more detail in an upcoming chapter, visual persuasion is stronger than oral persuasion. And most of the persuasion stack can be communicated either way. In practical terms, that means a visual presentation of a weaker form of persuasion could be stronger than a written or oral presentation of something higher in the stack. For example, visual persuasion involving a small fear would normally be more powerful than an academic discussion of a big fear that included no visuals. But if the communication method is the same, my ranking of the persuasion stack generally holds.

I’ll take you through the stack, starting with the weakest forms at the bottom.

### WORD-THINKING
Word-thinking is a term I invented to describe a situation in which people are trying to win an argument by adjusting the definition of words. In these situations there is no appeal to reason. But that’s okay, because facts and logic are not persuasive anyway. Word-thinking usually happens when people are bad at logic but don’t realize it. And that’s most of us, most of the time. So you see this form of nonthinking more than any other.

The clearest example of word-thinking is the abortion topic. Both sides try to win the debate by declaring their definition of “life” to be the accurate one. Most people agree that protecting human life is among our most important priorities, so if the antiabortion folks can define a fetus as living, they win the debate without resorting to any actual reasons or logic. It is easy to see why people try to win debates this way. But the other side is unlikely to change their opinions just because someone adjusted the definition of a word. Word-thinking simply isn’t persuasive.

As technology improves, we have to continually reassess what it means for a fetus to be alive. And that makes no sense at all. The current state of technology should make no difference to whether an entity is defined to be living or not. Both sides of the debate agree on what a fetus can and cannot do on its own. If I say the scientific description of a fetus fits my personal definition of what it means to be alive, and you say it does not, there is no place to go with that argument. Our best-case scenario is a tie.

We saw a lot of word-thinking in the presidential race of 2016. At the beginning of the election cycle we saw an ongoing debate about whether Donald Trump was “conservative” enough to be the Republican nominee. The people who said he was not a true conservative were trying to use word-thinking to eliminate Trump from consideration as the Republican candidate. Their problem was that people did not agree on what it meant to be conservative, nor did the public think it was especially important for Trump’s talents and policies to map to some underdefined political label. This was the blind spot in the Republican Party that allowed Trump to become their leader without being especially conservative. The entrenched interests in the GOP were doing word-thinking—literally the worst form of persuasion—to protect themselves from a Master Persuader with an enormous stockpile of persuasion weaponry. It was never a fair fight. As a trained persuader, I could see this developing from the start. As long as the Republican establishment clung to word-thinking for their defense, they had no defense at all.

### HYPOCRISY
On television news shows these days you often see pundits defending their side of an issue by saying their opponents do the same sorts of bad things, or have in the past. This is a good way to fill television time, and it might add some information to the conversation. But it can never be terribly persuasive to the viewer. The problem is that it frames both parties as naughty children. There are no winners in that framing.

I understand the impulse to cry hypocrisy. You don’t want the other side to claim their brand is pure while branding your side as wrongdoers. So you do have to sling back some mud. But the “Your side did it too” response is weak mud. The stronger mud is what I call the High-Ground Maneuver. I talk about this in more detail in the How to Use the High-Ground Maneuver chapter, but you need a sneak peek at the concept now for comparison purposes.

The High-Ground Maneuver involves taking the conversation out of the children-are-bickering mode and reframing it as you—the adult in the room—explaining to the children how things work. Let me give you an example, starting with the weak persuasion of claiming the other side is just as bad.

### Hypocrite Accusation

Pundit 1: Your side didn’t do enough to end street violence.

Pundit 2: Well, don’t forget that your side failed at it too!

Result: Tie. Both sides are bad.

High-Ground Maneuver

Pundit 1: Your side didn’t do enough to end street violence.

Pundit 2: I agree. Luckily we have learned a lot since then. A number of cities experimented with different approaches and some worked better than others. Let’s try to find the best practices and see if we can spread them to other cities.

Result: Pundit 1 is framed as the child who has nothing to offer but complaints. Pundit 2 demonstrates an adult understanding of how to solve problems over time.

> PERSUASION TIP 13
> Use the High-Ground Maneuver to frame yourself as the wise adult in the room. It forces others to join you or be framed as the small thinkers.

Notice I started by fully embracing the criticism from the other side. If you debate the criticism, you stay in a child frame. If you accept it and make a case for learning and improving, you move to the adult high ground and leave the children behind. Whenever you see claims of hypocrisy, you are also likely to see an opportunity for the High-Ground Maneuver.

### REASON
We humans like to think we are creatures of reason. We aren’t.1 The reality is that we make our decisions first and rationalize them later.2 It just doesn’t feel that way to us. That’s why I often said during the 2015–16 election that “facts and policies don’t matter.” Obviously the facts and policies do matter to outcomes. But in terms of persuasion, facts and policies and reason are almost useless.

The exception to this rule is when there is no emotional content to a decision and you have all the information you need. In those cases, we can use our capacity for reason. For example, you might use your sense of reason and your command of the facts to shop for the best price across multiple sellers. As long as you have no emotional investment in the topic, reason and facts can be quite persuasive. Once you remove emotion from the decision, reason and facts are all you have to go on.

But most topics in the real world are emotional. We are emotional about our relationships, our career choices, and our politics. And those topics can influence everything else we do. For example, if you are in a relationship, it is difficult to purchase anything meaningful without considering the emotional impact it will have on your partner. So even our most objective and simple choices acquire emotional dimensions over time because of the people around us.

We’re even emotional about our garbage. Consider the campaign that started decades ago to persuade citizens to recycle. The government can persuade some citizens to recycle simply by saying it is good for the planet. But you get more people to comply by making recycling a semipublic process. Visitors to your house will notice that you either have a recycling bin or not. And you can be sure they will judge you accordingly. And neighbors will see your trash and recyclables sitting by the curb in front of your house on trash pickup day. On its surface, the question of recycling is about resource management. That boring topic wouldn’t motivate many people to comply. But because recycling is semipublic by its nature, and people don’t want to be branded as bad citizens, they recycle when they know they are being watched. People are motivated to avoid social embarrassment.

The social pressure to recycle doesn’t end with the neighbors, either. Kids will pester parents to recycle because the kids learned about it in school. So parents are getting the stink eye from every direction when they don’t do a good job of recycling. The social pressure to recycle is enormous. But if you ask people why they recycle, they will tell you it is good for the planet. They won’t tell you they do it to avoid social embarrassment, or to be consistent with their identities as “green” people, or to be good role models for the kids. The recycling example is somewhat typical of how we run the rest of our lives. Sometimes we have access to good data and sometimes we use our limited powers of reason. But data and reason are generally subordinated to how we feel. We tell ourselves—and anyone else who will listen—that we are rational decision makers. But that is largely an illusion.

Your illusion of being a rational person is supported by the fact that sometimes you do act rationally. All the little things you do every day are probably rational. You brush your teeth to avoid cavities, you set your alarm clock to wake up on time, and so on. So your daily experience of living involves making one rational decision after another. You also believe—incorrectly—that you are rational when you make the big decisions about love and money and lifestyle. But that’s mostly a result of cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias. When we do irrational things—such as marry someone who is obviously a bad choice—we always have plenty of “reasons” to offer. But those reasons are rationalizations. And those rationalizations, along with your experience of being rational on the little decisions, creates for you the illusion that you are rational most of the time, including on the big decisions.

The illusion is helped along by the fact that even your big irrational decisions have plenty of rational thought at their base. For example, if you are looking for love, you probably use your sense of reason to eliminate from your search dead people, people in jail, and animals. You know that none of those approaches is likely to end well. So we do use reason to narrow down our choices. But when it comes to the final decision, our sense of reason takes a long walk while our irrational mind applies our biases, hopes, and fears to the decision. And when we are done with that irrational process, we will explain it to ourselves, and to anyone else who will listen, as a product of our rational thought.

It isn’t.

In the early parts of the 2016 presidential election, the media believed that Trump was picking up early support from people who liked his policies, especially his tough stand on immigration. I predicted early in the election that Trump—the Master Persuader—would moderate his policies in the general election and pick up new supporters without losing many of the old ones. This makes no sense if you think facts and policies matter. What mattered was that people saw Trump agree with them on an emotional dimension—that immigration was a big problem that needs fixing. Once he agreed with voters on an emotional level, he was free to tweak the details of his policies, and people followed him. What persuaded people to support Trump was his emotional connection. Trump’s policy details evolved over time. If the details of the policies mattered to people’s decisions, I have a hard time imagining Trump getting elected.

You might have seen a viral video on Jimmy Kimmel Live of street interviews in which a prankster presented Trump’s policy positions as Hillary Clinton’s policies and asked her supporters if they agreed with those positions.3 Lots of people said they did. I’ll take it one step further by saying Trump would have won the election even if he and Clinton had switched positions and erased our memories of their old opinions. It literally didn’t matter what policies either person brought to the table. People made up their minds based on biases alone. That is typical when you get to the final two candidates, as both of them are capable of doing the job. So we use our biases to break the tie. Later we will imagine that our reasons were totally rational.

### ANALOGIES

Analogies are a good way to explain a new concept. For example, I describe my start-up’s app (WhenHub) as being “like the Uber app without the Uber car.” And by that I mean any group of friends can stream their locations to one another as they approach a destination on the app’s map. The analogy is only my starting point for describing the app. Once I have established the basic concept, I can add details, and the listener has a framework to which they can attach the new information. That’s a sensible way to explain a new idea. You can use an analogy to give the listener a memory structure that you then embellish with details.

While analogies are useful and important for explaining new concepts, here’s the important point for our purposes: Analogies are terrible for persuasion.

> PERSUASION TIP 14
> When you attack a person’s belief, the person under attack is more likely to harden his belief than to abandon it, even if your argument is airtight.

Unfortunately, most people believe that analogies are one of the best ways to persuade. That fact goes far in explaining why it seems that every debate on the Internet ends with a Hitler analogy. The phenomenon is so common it has its own name: Godwin’s law. But I doubt many people have changed an opinion just because a stranger on the Internet compared them to Hitler. A direct attack usually just hardens people into their current opinions.

There are two good reasons why analogies fail to persuade. The first is that they are a form of pseudologic, much like word-thinking. For people who are unfamiliar with the mechanics of logic and reason, analogies feel as if they should work. And how can you explain the prevalence of Hitler analogies if they don’t persuade? Wouldn’t someone have noticed by now?

I can answer those questions.

People are irrational. If something feels as if it should work, most of us conclude that it does. We don’t have the time or resources to do scientific inquiry on every choice we make. So we use our “common sense” and our “gut feeling” to get by. That’s the typical worldview. But the Persuasion Filter says your common sense and gut feelings are little more than magical thinking.

Most of us believe we have common sense. And yet we disagree with one another about what that looks like. That’s all you need to know about common sense. The illusion is that you have this thing called common sense and many others do not. The Persuasion Filter takes it one step further and says no one has common sense. According to the filter, sometimes we make good choices and sometimes we don’t. When things go wrong, we blame the environment or bad luck, or we imagine it was a rare misfire by our common sense. When things turn out in our favor, we believe it is because we have common sense and it served us well. In both cases it is no more than rationalization after the fact.

One of the common views of reality is that we humans can reach good decisions based on some combination of subconscious thoughts and bodily sensations. We like to justify that decision-making process with words such as “hunch,” “instinct,” and “intuition.” The Persuasion Filter says this is just one of the ways we rationalize the awkward fact that we are not using our sense of reason to make decisions. When a decision involves lots of facts, and we have access to all the facts, we are more likely to hallucinate that we used our powers of reason to reach a decision. But when we recognize that we don’t have all the facts, we hallucinate that we used our gut feeling to bridge the gap. In both cases we acted irrationally, and we tried to rationalize it to ourselves after the fact. That’s how the Persuasion Filter sees it.

The Persuasion Filter does not attempt to explain reality, if there is such a thing. I present it as a useful filter for understanding your world and predicting what might happen next. If a filter on reality makes you happy, and it does a good job predicting, that is probably a good filter.

But let’s get back to analogies.

As I explained, the first reason analogies fail at persuasion is that they are not designed for that job. Analogies are not logic. They are just a quick way to explain a new concept.

The second reason analogies fail is because they are imprecise by definition. That gives people on the other side of a debate all kinds of ammunition. And no one changes their mind when they have that much ammunition for a defense. As it turns out, all of the ammunition provided by bad analogies is in the form of blanks, because analogies are not persuasive, and neither are the criticisms of analogies. If you are arguing about the details of an analogy, you are not persuading, and you are not being persuaded. You are just wasting time.


But what about comparing Trump to Hitler? Wasn’t that persuasive?

On social media, and sometimes even in the mainstream media, Clinton’s supporters relentlessly compared Trump to Hitler. It was brutally effective persuasion when packaged with related accusations about his “temperament” and his strongman vibe. Fear is the strongest level of persuasion, and the Persuasion Filter would say the Hitler-related persuasion made a difference in the election.

You might wonder why I say analogies do not persuade while at the same time I say the comparisons of Trump to Hitler were effective. The answers to that question will take you to a deeper level of understanding about persuasion.

My hypothesis—consistent with the Persuasion Filter—is that people who already had a firm opinion of Trump were not persuaded by the Hitler analogies. That is consistent with analogies being a weak form of persuasion.

But not all voters had a firm opinion of Trump. If you are young, you probably didn’t experience much of Trump’s personal history as it happened. And if you didn’t watch The Apprentice, you didn’t know him from there either. For the people who didn’t already know Trump, the Hitler analogy was effective, not because analogies are persuasive but because this one did a good job explaining Trump for the first time to people who had no deep knowledge of him. Remember, analogies are great for explaining a new concept. And this concept of Trump as a new Hitler was filling an empty space for lots of voters who didn’t know much about Trump. And this brings us to another persuasion topic I have already mentioned: anchors.


::: tip HOW TO CREATE MENTAL ANCHORS
The first thing you hear about a new topic automatically becomes an anchor in your mind that biases your future opinions. In the comic above, Dilbert’s nemesis got to Dilbert’s boss first and told him Dilbert was a liar. That would prime the boss’s filter to expect Dilbert to lie, with confirmation bias nearly guaranteeing that he would see things that way in the future.

But if Dilbert had complained to his boss first, Dilbert would maintain his credibility, and whoever called him a liar later would have a tougher sell. In the 3-D world of persuasion, going first makes a big difference.

You see this technique most often from good negotiators. They open with a ridiculously low or ridiculously high offer to bias the other side in that direction. For example, suppose you offered to be my consultant and I have no idea what your services are worth. If the first thing you tell me is that some clients pay you $1,000 per hour, I’m more likely to agree to a higher price than if the first number you told me was $100. The initial number becomes a mental anchor that is hard to move. That’s why you should always be the first to offer numbers, even if you are talking about an entirely different situation. (Yes, that works. See Robert Cialdini’s great book Pre-Suasion.)

For example, let’s say you are trying to sell your business, and neither you nor your potential buyer knows what it is worth. A business is only as good as its future, and the future is unknown. So there is a lot of bias and guessing involved when anyone buys a one-of-a-kind business. If you are the seller of the business, you want to prime the buyer by mentioning the high price paid by someone else in an entirely different context. That’s often enough to anchor a person to the high number even though it is a different conversation.

For example, if you would be happy to get $5 million for your company, it might help to have a casual conversation before the negotiations about a billionaire who bought a $25 million yacht. Once the $25 million figure gets into your buyer’s head—even though it has nothing to do with the company you are selling—it forms an anchor. And it might help you get a higher price.

When my start-up partners and I were brainstorming how to describe WhenHub.com to investors, we had lots of valid ways to start that description, all based on fact and all totally appropriate and honest. I steered the team toward opening with a comparison of the ways in which WhenHub could be viewed as a new player in the office-suite application space (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides). Those are multibillion-dollar products. We think WhenHub belongs in that group, sizewise and functionwise. That opening idea anchors investors to the vastness of the opportunity.

Is this sort of framing unethical? It depends on the situation. I wouldn’t use this method to negotiate with a family member or friend. But in a business context, you expect both sides to be using commercial-grade persuasion of this sort. And you don’t want to go to a gunfight armed only with a knife. In a business negotiation, each side expects at least some hyperbole and “selling” technique from the other. Make your own decision about whether it’s ethical to use the same persuasion tools your adversaries are using.

In the case of WhenHub, the comparison to office-suite products is entirely appropriate and we back it up. The sneakier form of persuasion would involve talking about recent unicorn start-ups in general before making our pitch, to benefit from any unconscious mental associations. That would be pure persuasion without helpful information, and you can use your judgment on the ethics of it. I wouldn’t use it on a friend, but I would use it in a hostage negotiation.
:::

The human brain forms a bias for the things it hears first. If we accept the thing we hear first, it tends to harden into an irrational belief. And then it is difficult to dislodge. If your friends are reinforcing the idea too, it becomes hard as steel.

The Persuasion Filter predicts that people who already had a favorable opinion of Trump would not be persuaded by analogies, including Hitler analogies, no matter how skillfully applied. But for those who didn’t yet have a firm opinion of Trump, the Hitler analogy formed an anchor that was hard to move. The details of the analogy were unimportant. All that mattered was the association. And this leads me to my next point: Associations matter more than reason.

The Hitler analogy was effective not because analogies are logical or persuasive but because any association of two things is persuasive. If you compare any two things long enough, their qualities start to merge in our irrational minds. The illusion created by analogies is that if two situations have anything in common, perhaps they have lots in common. Trump has a few things in common with Hitler—as do we all—and that makes some of his critics irrationally believe he will also invade Poland.

Pulling all of this together, analogies are not persuasive on their own. But if the analogy is simply a carrier for a persuasive association—let’s say, comparing any strong leader to Hitler—the association can be persuasive to some, even while the details of the analogy are ridiculous.

Now watch me summarize this point by using an analogy, because analogies are good at explaining new concepts: If your analogy includes a strong negative association (such as Hitler), you could think of the analogy as a holster and the negative association as a gun. The gun is persuasive. The holster is not.

### HABIT
If you want to influence someone to try a new product, it helps to associate it with some part of an existing habit. For example, people usually follow a consistent routine of shaving, showering, makeup, hair, brushing their teeth, etc. The vitamin industry grafted onto that habit when some marketing genius suggested that people should take vitamins once a day. That probably isn’t the best way for your body to absorb vitamins and minerals because some of them pass from your body quickly. Biologically speaking, the most effective vitamin-taking schedule would involve multiple doses spread across your day. But if you want to sell lots of vitamins, you attach the habit to people’s existing get-ready routine—once per day. That makes it stick.

To put it another way, if vitamin companies relied on you to take your vitamins at any random time you liked, it probably wouldn’t happen as often as they want. But the early marketers of vitamins cleverly convinced us that taking vitamins fits into our existing waking-up and/or going-to-bed habits. Now the practice of taking vitamins around the same time as you are brushing your teeth seems easy and natural. So we keep doing it.

The makers of the first fitness trackers had habit working for them too. You put your fitness band on your arm as part of your getting-dressed routine in the morning. That helps it stick.

This form of persuasion—grafting onto existing habits—usually isn’t helpful for politics because big national topics don’t fit into your daily habits. The main way habits come into play for politics is in the way we consume news. So if you wanted to use habit to influence politics, you might call your news program something like Morning Joe, which is the name of a show on MSNBC featuring Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. That tells people it fits into their morning habit.

> PERSUASION TIP 15
> Studies say humans more easily get addicted to unpredictable rewards than they do predictable rewards.

Habit persuasion is why I started branding my live-streaming on Periscope and YouTube as Coffee with Scott Adams. I wanted people to associate my content with their morning coffee, so it became part of their habit. Based on comments from users, that strategy has been effective. People reported to me that I became part of their morning routine and they missed it when I skipped a day.

Speaking of skipping a day, that reminds me of Persuasion Tip 15.

Now ask yourself whether President Trump rewards his supporters in a predictable way or in an unpredictable way. Right, he is unpredictable as heck. In the morning he disappoints, but by lunchtime he delights. You never know what is coming. And that, in part, is why his supporters are addicted to him.

### ASPIRATIONS

It isn’t easy to change people’s aspirations, and you would have no reason to try unless the aspirations were somehow harmful or dangerous. But you can improve the power of your persuasion by grafting your story onto people’s existing aspirations. You see this a lot in product marketing. For example, Apple tells you that its products will help you be creative. For many people, being more creative is an aspiration. And some financial services companies tell you they will help you be financially independent. That too is an aspiration for most people.

When President Trump was campaigning, he played directly to voter aspirations. He told the unemployed and underemployed that they would someday have good jobs. He told us he would make America safer, richer, and just plain greater, in a variety of ways. That is good aspirational persuasion.

Compare that with Hillary Clinton’s campaign slogan about being “Stronger Together.” National strength sounds like a good quality to have, but it doesn’t feel aspirational. It almost feels defensive. And her main message of being more of the same in terms of being like the Obama administration had no aspirational quality whatsoever. Maintaining a steady course is not an aspiration for people who need help.

Some pundits say Trump won because he was the candidate of change. But not all change is equal. Becoming stronger together is a change, but it doesn’t speak to our personal aspirations. Trump’s theme about jobs speaks directly to aspirational change.

In my opinion, change as a stand-alone concept was not a persuasive element in the election. The active part of the persuasion is the change to what. Trump offered the more aspirational persuasion.

### FEAR (BIG AND SMALL)

Fear can be deeply persuasive. But not all fear-related persuasion is equal. To maximize your fear persuasion, follow these guidelines.

A big fear is more persuasive than a small one.

A personal fear is more persuasive than a generic national problem.

A fear that you think about most often is stronger than one you rarely think about.

A fear with a visual component is scarier than one without.

A fear you have experienced firsthand (such as a crime) is scarier than a statistic.

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump used fear in their campaign persuasion. Trump spoke of the fears of terrorism and crime from undocumented immigrants. Clinton’s brand didn’t allow her to use those same fears for persuasion, so she cleverly used Trump himself as the object of fear by painting him as a racist, sexist, homophobic, erratic dictator with the nuclear launch codes. Branding Trump as the next Hitler (without using that actual word) was Clinton’s most powerful persuasion strategy. Had this been the only variable in the campaign, Clinton would have won.

### IDENTITY

If you don’t have an opportunity to scare people into doing what you want them to do, the next-strongest technique is an appeal to identity. We saw President Obama win over 90 percent of the African American vote. We saw most women prefer Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump. And so on. People like to back their “tribe” as they see it. And all of us are in multiple tribes if you consider our genders, ethnicities, ages, wealth, religions, political parties, and all the rest. Humans reflexively support their own tribe. No thinking is involved.

This reflex makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. The people on your team were the ones helping to keep you alive. The people on every other team were trying to kill you or take your resources. We evolved to feel safer with, and to generally prefer, people who are similar to us in any substantial way. This instinct to support our own team is the reason major sports are big business. It makes no logical sense to support your local team just because it is local. But we do. It is a reflex.

President Trump used identity persuasion to remind voters that they were Americans first. Clinton used identity persuasion to tell women, minorities, and the LGBTQ community that they were on her team.

The interesting thing about the candidates’ identity persuasion is that Clinton stuck with genetic distinctions and Trump did a High-Ground Maneuver by speaking to the way we are socialized (brainwashed) to feel patriotic. There is no way to know which strategy was more persuasive, but both were strong.

The next time someone is doing something you find objectionable, don’t attack that person’s actions. Instead, ask if this is who the person wants to be. Most people think they are good people, even if they sometimes do bad things. If you remind them of their identity, and their aspirations for their identity, you will usually be met with cognitive dissonance and an implied promise to change. That might look like this:

Other person: “I like defacing the political signs on the other side. Ha-ha! It’s hilarious.”

You: “Is that the person you want to be?”

Other person (now with cognitive dissonance): “Um, I was just doing it that one time because I was with Bob, and we had some drinks.”

Obviously this method won’t work with kids, or with adults who have cultivated a brand around doing all the wrong things. But if you catch a normal adult doing something outside what you imagine is their aspiration of a core identity, you can sometimes flip them to be compatible with their preferred identity almost instantly. Just point out the gap and watch it close.

## SETTING THE TABLE
One of the ways I make myself more persuasive is by telling people I’m a trained hypnotist and that I am familiar with all of the tools of influence. I learned in hypnosis class that it is easier to persuade people when they expect to be persuaded. If your persuasion skills are viewed as credible, people will persuade themselves that you can persuade them, and that makes everything easier. Credibility, of any sort, is persuasive. That’s why doctors and lawyers post their degrees on the wall where everyone can see them. That’s why high-end consultants wear expensive business suits. When you signal your credentials, people expect you to have more influence over them. That’s how we’re wired. We defer to experts almost automatically.

In 1987 Donald Trump’s book The Art of the Deal became a number one New York Times best seller. The book’s success told the world that Trump was more than a rich kid who inherited a fortune from Dad. It sent the message that Trump was self-made (to a degree) because of his negotiating talents. And once you convince the world that you are a great negotiator, that version of reality becomes self-fulfilling. It is easier to persuade people when they expect you to be persuasive.

> PERSUASION TIP 16
> It is easier to persuade a person who believes you are persuasive.

Imagine going into a negotiation against a business adversary who literally wrote the book on negotiating. In some cases, I assume Trump’s reputation as a skilled negotiator stiffened the resistance of the people on the other side of the deal. But my educated guess, based on what I know about persuasion, is that Trump’s reputation as a negotiator gave his opponents a subconscious form of permission to do poorly in negotiating against him. You expect the better negotiator to come out ahead, so there is no shame if it happens. Trump has enjoyed that advantage since his book was published. The book is not just about persuasion—it is persuasion.

I also learned in hypnosis class that it is easier to hypnotize someone who is paying you for the service. And the more the client pays, the easier it is for the hypnotist, because charging a higher price assigns a higher perceived value to your skills. That’s why I practiced my hypnosis on paying customers. I ran an ad in a local publication offering to use hypnosis to regress people back to memories of prior lives. Anecdotally, it did seem to me that the paying customers were easier to hypnotize compared with random volunteers. People who are willing to pay money for hypnosis are more motivated, and that makes a big difference. And they assumed my hypnosis skills were commercial grade because they were paying for the experience. That is the ideal setup for persuasion. My subjects wanted and expected to be influenced.

I should mention that I don’t believe in reincarnation, although I was open to the idea at the time I was learning hypnosis. Under hypnosis, my paying clients described in detail what they imagined were their prior lives. Listening to those manufactured memories—that I intentionally caused—was enough to convince me that people can’t really remember prior lives under hypnosis. I came to that conclusion because none of my subjects ever described a prior life that isn’t the topic of lots of movies. My subjects tended to “remember” being Native Americans, Egyptian queens, Vikings, and other well-known historical types. No one ever “remembered” a prior life that would be unfamiliar to modern people. And none of my clients said they were Chinese in a prior life, which seems statistically unlikely given that a quarter of the planet is Chinese.

The concept of setting the table for persuasion has a lot of obvious elements, such as dressing for the part and broadcasting your credentials. But there is also a deeper and scarier level that cognitive scientists have discovered. It turns out that you can influence people’s future opinions simply by exposing them to cleverly selected images and ideas that are totally unrelated to the topic of your persuasion. The best book on this topic is Pre-Suasion, by Robert Cialdini. One of the examples involves showing subjects images of the American flag before following up with political questions. People who saw the flag image became instantly more amenable to Republican positions. This pre-suasion, as Cialdini calls it, doesn’t work on every person. But it doesn’t need to. When you are persuading large groups, such as potential customers or voters, you might need to move only 5 percent of them to turn loss into victory.

Cognitive scientists have lots of examples of this form of pre-suasion. Many of them are not obvious in terms of how people will respond. I would not have guessed an American flag biases people Republican. And I would not have guessed that exposing people to stories of generosity would make them more generous on unrelated topics just minutes later. But it does.

The best way to think of pre-suasion is that it creates an emotional state that bleeds over from unrelated topics to the topic of your persuasion. If the American flag makes you feel patriotic, and patriotism is more associated in your mind with Republicans (irrationally or not), that’s good enough to persuade.

Kids, if you want to persuade your parents to do something nice for you, first show them a YouTube video of someone being nice to their pets. Then change the subject to whatever it is that you want. The emotional state your parents picked up from watching pet-related kindness should rub off and cause them to look more kindly on whatever you are asking them to do for you. Pre-suading, or setting the table, is about creating mental and emotional associations that carry over. If you get the mood right, and your credibility is high, you’re halfway done with your persuasion before anyone knows you started.

Here’s a checklist you can use to see how well you set the table for your own future persuasion. Make sure you . . .

- Dress for the part. If you dress like a knowledgeable professional, people will assume your opinions and advice are credible. That makes it easier to persuade.
- Improve your physical appearance via diet, exercise, hair care, etc. Attractive people are more persuasive.
- Broadcast your credentials in a way that appears natural and not braggy. People admire talent but they hate bragging.
- Brand yourself as a winner. If people expect you to win, they will be biased toward making it happen.
- Meet in the most impressive space you can control. This creates a physical and visual impression that broadcasts your power, talent, and success.
- Set expectations ahead of time. If people expect you to ask for the moon, they will be delighted when you agree to accept less. And when people expect you to be the better negotiator, they will be subtly biased toward that outcome.
- Pre-suade with thoughts and images that will bias people toward a frame of mind that is compatible with your upcoming persuasion. For example, if you want someone to be generous with you, prime the pump with an unrelated story of kindness.
- Bring high energy. People with high energy are more persuasive. We’re all drawn to energy.
- This checklist will help you set the table for persuasion, but you still need a lot of technique once you are in the same room. Let’s talk about technique next.

## GO BIGLY OR GO HOME

Whenever there is mass confusion and complexity, people automatically gravitate to the strongest, most confident voice. We humans don’t like uncertainty, so we are attracted to those who offer clarity and simple answers, even if the answers are wrong or incomplete. Master Persuaders can thrive in chaotic environments by offering the clarity people crave. And if an environment is not chaotic already, a skilled persuader who understands both social media and the news business can easily stir the pot to create an advantage through chaos. Candidate Trump was a champion of this method.

There is an old banking saying: If you borrow a million dollars from a bank, the bank essentially owns you. But if you borrow $10 billion, you own the bank. That’s because the bank can foreclose on your measly million-dollar loan without much pain on its side, but the bank would have trouble surviving if it wrote off a $10 billion loss. The bank is forced to work with a large borrower, and maybe renegotiate terms. But the million-dollar borrower is out of luck because the bank has all the power at that dollar level.

This reminds me a lot of Trump’s strategy of sucking all the energy out of the news cycle until his competition had no way to breathe. If Trump had tiptoed into the election, the mainstream media would have owned him. And they would have treated him like a clown, before moving on to talk about his competition. So Trump didn’t tiptoe. He went in so hard, and so provocatively, that the media had no economic choice but to focus on him. He was pure gold for the press. And because of that, he came to own them, at least in the limited sense of dominating their news cycle.

If you don’t know a lot about persuasion, or strategy, or the news media’s business model, you might have seen Trump’s actions as symptoms of narcissism and buffoonery, nothing more. You might have asked yourself who in their right mind would intentionally be so provocative as to attract nonstop negative news coverage. The answer is a Master Persuader. The extra criticism was worth the pain because it sucked up all the media attention and rendered his Republican primary challengers invisible.

Amazingly, Trump’s strategy worked even though the news coverage it invited was overwhelmingly negative. This highlights a dividing line between a normal trained persuader and a true Master Persuader. Trump probably knew that one arrow in the chest could kill him, but if he had a thousand arrows, lined up just right, he could sleep on top of their pointy ends the same way a bed of nails works. No individual arrow’s point has to support much weight if you bunch them closely together. Trump deactivated the incoming attacks by ensuring there were too many of them. The news business has to cover the newest stories, at the expense of the old ones. Trump could relegate any unflattering story to the back burner by introducing new provocations (often via tweet) every day.

How do I know Trump was cleverly and intentionally hogging all of the press attention—both good and bad—and not simply flailing around? We have reports that Trump told people in advance he planned to suck all the oxygen out of the race.1 That doesn’t mean it happened. But by the end of this book, I hope to persuade you it would be consistent with Trump’s persuasion skills.

Trump used his mastery of the news cycle to create the impression that he was the most important person running for president, even if you hated him. When people are important, we start to feel they must be capable too, at least to some degree, because being capable is usually what makes people important. Our minds are primed to see important, capable people as leaders. And that instinct—to follow the most important and capable leader—can be more influential than facts and policies.

> PERSUASION TIP 17
> People prefer certainty over uncertainty, even when the certainty is wrong.

Trump was confident and clear about his priorities. But he was famously unclear about his preferred policy details. That is good persuasion technique. It allowed supporters to see whatever they wanted to see. But the details never mattered as much as the big picture. And the big picture was that Trump was a clear and strong voice in a scary and confusing world.

## IS PRESIDENT TRUMP A “NATURAL” PERSUADER?

The question I heard the most during the election of 2016 was about the source of Trump’s persuasion talent. Was he a “natural,” or did he learn his technique in some rigorous fashion? The question matters because if he learned his skills, you can learn them too. But if he is a natural, you might be out of luck. I don’t know the full answer to the question, but I can tell you it looks more like technique than lucky genes to me. Almost everything Trump does is persuasion correct, based on best practices in the fields of business and persuasion, as far as I can tell. It would be hard to be so consistent without a deep knowledge of the tools of persuasion.

Let’s look at the clues to see how much of Trump’s persuasion is based on training and knowledge versus natural ability.

### THE NORMAN VINCENT PEALE CONNECTION
In the 1970s, Fred and Mary Trump and their kids started attending Marble Collegiate Church in New York City, which had a famous pastor named Norman Vincent Peale.1 Young readers of this book might not recognize that name, but people above a certain age know him as the author of the super successful book The Power of Positive Thinking. It was a mega–best seller. Peale is one of the most important authors and thinkers in American history. He influenced millions.

Including me.

Peale told me I could do anything if I simply thought about it the right way. It was a huge perceptual shift and it freed me from the prison I had created in my own mind. So I used my powers of positive thinking to focus on someday becoming a rich and famous cartoonist who can do his work while sitting by the beach.

I’m writing this paragraph at the beach.

True story.

Peale was good. He was very good.

Peale’s book taught people about the power of the mind and its ability to author a great life. You can see in Trump a type of positive thinking that appears to be important to his success. The public has now watched more than once as Trump imagined succeeding in a new field and then did it. Evidently, he doesn’t see any limit on how successful he can be. Trump has said in interviews that Peale was a big influence on him. It is hard to know how much, but you can see the Peale “filter” coming through in everything Trump does. In some sense, Trump thought himself into the presidency.

Oh, and one more interesting thing about Peale: In his day, people accused him of being a hypnotist.2 Apparently he was so persuasive that some people assumed he had a secret skill set. I wouldn’t call Peale’s methods hypnosis, but he was a Master Persuader for sure. And Trump learned it from the source.

The best source ever.

So if Trump is a “natural,” it would be quite a coincidence that he had so much contact with a Master Persuader of the highest caliber.

As an aside, I would love to see a study of the other kids who attended Peale’s church. I’ll bet the quality of their lives is above average. But that’s just an educated guess.

### THE ART OF THE DEAL
Trump authored one of the most popular books of all time on the topic of negotiating, which is a special form of persuasion. The book is The Art of the Deal, published in 1987.

His coauthor, Tony Schwartz, did the writing, but it shows Trump’s interest in the topic of persuasion. You tend to learn the things that you care about. And Trump cares about negotiating. He mentions it nearly every day. And obviously he often negotiated over the course of his career.

Years ago I learned of something called reticular activation. In this context, it refers to the brain’s natural ability to filter out information that you don’t need, making it is easier to spot the things you do need. That’s why you can hear someone call your name in a noisy room when you can’t make out any other words. Your name is important to you, so your brain has a sensitive filter for it. In general, we notice things that matter and ignore things that don’t. We have to do this because otherwise the environment would be sending too many signals to our little brains at the same time.

After 1987, when The Art of the Deal was a huge best seller, Trump’s brain became “tuned” to the topics of negotiating and persuasion. He made negotiating his brand, and that means his brain started to recognize other persuasion methods in his environment because that was his new filter. Negotiating was important to Trump, so he was more likely to seek new information on the topic, casually and otherwise. In other words, even if you think Trump’s coauthor wrote every word of The Art of the Deal, and even if you think Trump knew little about negotiating in 1987, the fact that it became his brand virtually guaranteed he would become an expert in it over time simply because his filters were set to absorb that kind of information. And the topic is easily absorbed. It isn’t physics.

I had a similar experience after taking hypnosis classes. Once my filters were set to notice persuasion, I saw it everywhere. I was more likely to notice persuasion-related headlines and to read them. I was more likely to notice persuasion in life and to analyze those situations to understand the key variables. I became a persuasion-knowledge magnet. And I learned a lot about persuasion, over time, without really trying. Trump’s situation was similar. Once he branded himself as a great negotiator, it almost guaranteed he would learn a lot more on the topic going forward.

It would be hard for a “natural” persuader to be pitch-perfect in persuasion. You might expect a natural but untrained persuader to exaggerate, play on your emotions, and use visual imagery. You would expect to see all the tricks of a car salesperson too. But all of those tricks are common knowledge, and they don’t speak to any deep training in persuasion. A highly trained persuader would display more complexity in persuasion. It would look more engineered, if you knew what you were looking for.

The following chapters will lift the lid on Trump’s persuasion so you can see the engineering. It is impressive.
