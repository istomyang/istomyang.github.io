# PART 5 WHY JOINING A TRIBE MAKES YOU POWERFUL AND BLIND

## HOW I USED THE PERSUASION FILTER TO PREDICT
As I mentioned earlier in the book, a good filter on reality is one that makes you happy and does a good job of predicting the future. My Persuasion Filter checked both boxes. My followers on Twitter enjoyed my predictions and found them to be downright spooky in their accuracy. I’ll describe a few of the fun ones.

### PREDICTING THE TOUCHING AND LOVE

Candidate Trump’s biggest problem toward the end of the campaign, by far, was that the Clinton team did a great job of branding him as a racist. It was strong persuasion, and it required a well-engineered persuasion response. Visual persuasion is the only type powerful enough for this situation. As I mentioned in a prior chapter, I suggested (some said predicted) that Trump could solve the racism accusations with some well-chosen visuals. Watch how this idea developed in my blog posts over three months.

Posted April 25, 2016

Trump can prove he’s not a racist. That’s easy. All he needs to do is hug a bunch of nonwhite folks on camera. Real racists don’t hug the ones they dislike. They just don’t.

Posted May 6, 2016

I recently blogged that Trump’s best strategy against charges of racism would be to hug a lot of nonwhite people in public. Racists can’t do that. Racists can lie, but no one is convinced by words in this sort of situation. Actions, on the other hand, are usually unambiguous. If Trump had any trouble kissing nonwhite babies, it would be obvious to all. You can’t fake physical affection when the cameras are rolling. Expect more hugging and kissing.

And indeed we did see candidate Trump being openly affectionate with African Americans, especially babies who didn’t want any part of it. Now you might say, and fairly so, politicians kiss babies all the time. That’s true. But a quick search of Google images will tell you that the photos of Trump kissing black babies happened mostly after my predictions, and after a summer of Clinton hammering Trump on his alleged racist ways. When Clinton started focusing on the racism card during the summer of 2016, Trump’s poll numbers started to decline. By election day, Trump ended up getting more African American votes than the prior Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.1 That isn’t a fair comparison because Romney’s opponent was Barack Obama. Still, it could have been worse for Trump, and no one would have been surprised.

Does the fact that candidate Trump did exactly what I suggested mean I somehow influenced the campaign? No. In this case it was fairly obvious that creating more photo opportunities with African American voters was a good persuasion strategy. I won’t take credit for suggesting an idea that would be obvious to any experienced persuader. The interesting point I’ll make here is that you can fit this data to three different filters on reality. It fits the filter that says I was predicting what the Trump campaign would do. It fits the filter that I was influencing the campaign, if that makes you happy. And it fits the filter that I did little more than describe a common political practice. But no matter the filter, it supports my main thesis that Trump knows persuasion and applies it. Persuasion-wise, this was the right play. It was visual persuasion (the best kind), and on point.

### PREDICTING THAT TRUMP WOULD BE RUNNING UNOPPOSED

By late 2015 I was predicting that Clinton had undisclosed health issues that would result in Trump “running unopposed” by election day. And I based that prediction on nothing but my skill as a hypnotist to detect “tells” in a person.

Sound crazy?

Researchers believe they can create a bathroom mirror that will detect major health issues by detecting day-to-day changes in your face.2 And it makes sense that humans would evolve to recognize potential mates with the best health. You know from experience that you can tell when a loved one is sick just by observation. We’re all capable of detecting a deathly ill person by appearance alone. Some of us are more observant and can detect smaller signals and lesser illnesses. Doctors, for example, are probably far better than the average person at visually detecting illness in a patient, thanks to both training and experience.

Hypnotists are not doctors, but we do learn to observe small “tells” in a subject’s face. And that means we are more likely to notice any small variations from day to day, simply because we are attuned to them. Minor variations in a person’s face, from one day to the next, are reliable indicators of a health issue, even if the issue is just stress or a lack of sleep.

What I saw in Hillary Clinton was an unusual degree of variability in her appearance that you don’t find in healthy people. Some days she looked great. Other days she looked tired, pained, and sickly. Her health appearance was all over the place. Compare that with Trump. He looked the same every time you saw him. That’s a sign of good health.

Now consider the audacity of my prediction that Clinton’s health would take her out of the race by election day. Has something like that ever happened to a presidential candidate in the final months? There were no medical reports to back up my prediction. It seemed to many observers that I was either crazy or being intentionally provocative. Worse yet, my opinion on Clinton’s health was viewed as totally irresponsible because I am not a doctor, and I had no business putting those thoughts in people’s heads.

My explanation for my actions at the time was that the Persuasion Filter needed the most rigorous test I could give it in public. I was intentionally predicting the hard-to-predict so I could show the power of persuasion. In any other context, I would agree that people with no medical training should avoid speculation about the health of candidates. But I was doing a public demonstration of persuasion that I believed to be important. And I was also confident about my prediction. Otherwise I wouldn’t have mentioned it.

Two months before the election, Clinton lost consciousness at a September 11 memorial event and was captured on video as her Secret Service team dragged her unconscious body into an SUV. The official story from the Clinton camp was that she was dehydrated. Soon afterward, they clarified that the problem was pneumonia. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days before resuming a pared-down schedule appropriate to her energy at the time. In the closing months she didn’t even campaign in some states that she (mistakenly) thought were safe wins.

In a literal sense, Trump never ran “unopposed.” But my unlikely prediction of a health issue taking Clinton out of the race turned out to be so close to reality that my Twitter followers considered it spooky.

The Persuasion Filter predicts that more information about Clinton’s health during the campaign will leak out over time. For her sake, I hope I’m wrong. But if I’m right, you’ll want to reread this book.

### PREDICTING THE TURN TO “TEAM” INSTEAD OF “TRUMP”

Clinton and her supporters did a great job during the campaign of branding Trump as “divisive.” It was good persuasion because Trump kept serving up lots of confirmation bias to support their claim. Anytime he talked tough, his opponents labeled him “divisive.”

Clinton’s Web site included a lengthy article detailing his divisive ways, with this title: “America Deserves Better Than This: Trump’s Divisive and Offensive Rhetoric Prove He’s Unfit to Be President.”

A quick Google search on “Trump divisive” returns millions of results. The attack was working. People saw divisiveness in everything Trump did. He made it easy with his provocative rhetoric. It was a big problem, and Trump needed to solve it. In July of 2016, I helpfully posted this.

Posted July 18, 2016

Have you ever noticed that professional sports teams are great at overcoming racism and getting everyone to play together? That’s because the coach has persuaded the players to see the team as their dominant identity. Trump can do the same with America. Just tell us we’re on the same team, and that we’re in a friendly competition with the rest of the world. I don’t care what gender and ethnicity you are, so long as you’re with me on the American team and helping to compete against the rest of the world.

The words “Team America” would be the strongest persuasion this country has ever seen. That framing loses the xenophobia and hate, and defines us as part of a friendly competition with the world. The only downside is that Team America is the name of a hilarious puppet movie by the creators of South Park. But I think we can get past that.

I’m on Team America. If you’re on my team, I don’t need to know anything else about you. We’re good.

By late October, Trump had changed his stump speech to emphasize the word “we.” Here are some excerpts from an October 23, 2016, speech:3

“We are going to bring back the American dream.”

“It is gridlock in Washington. Lack of leadership in Washington. And we are going to stop it.”

“We are going to have a dynamic country.”

People noticed (and it might have been confirmation bias) that Trump’s move to “we” came after my blog on the topic, and they connected what they imagined to be the dots. They wondered on social media if I had influenced the change. I don’t claim any influence in this situation because this was a fairly obvious response to the “divisive” branding.

On the other hand, this move had been an obvious way to go for months. And sooner would have been better. The timing of the shift, so soon after my blog post on the topic, was enough to supply confirmation bias to my Twitter followers. To them, it was obvious I had influenced the move. But I don’t make that claim. My claim is that trained persuaders think alike. Trump simply did what anyone with his skill set would have done.

### PREDICTING BOLTON’S MUSTACHE PROBLEM

After winning the election, President-elect Trump went about the business of filling his cabinet. Normally, cabinet appointments are based on competence, experience, loyalty to the president, and other normal stuff. In the 2-D world, that is all you think you need. But a Master Persuader operating in the third dimension also pays attention to the brand.

Those of us who want to live in a just society don’t want a person’s appearance to be a job qualification. But you can’t change human nature. We are visual creatures, and irrational too. Looks matter, even when we wish they did not. Looks are part of the brand, and Trump was trying to build a brand that people would like. This brings us to John Bolton.

John Bolton was on the short list for secretary of state. He was thoroughly qualified, Republican, and a Trump supporter. Many observers thought he would get the job. But he had two incompatibilities with the brand that Trump was trying to build:

He had an unusual mustache (by the standards of 2017).

He was famously hawkish, meaning he was a proponent of projecting American military power when it was in the national interest.

In a more normal year, neither of those things would be a stopper. But the context in this case was that Trump had been branded as the next Hitler. This is how I explained it at the time in my blog.

Posted December 6, 2016

Bolton would be the biggest brand mistake for Trump. Bolton is highly capable, but he gives off a scary vibe, and that is the worst branding mistake Trump could make. Half of the United States is already living under an illusion that Hitler just got elected president of the United States. If you add a war-loving white guy with a strange mustache to the illusion, you’re just making things worse. Trump’s biggest problem, brandwise, is that so many people think he’s a crazy dictator who can’t be trusted with the nuclear codes. Bolton is the only candidate who makes that illusion worse. I don’t see Master Persuader Trump making a mistake of that size.

Trump eventually picked Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. The Washington Post reported on December 22, 2016, that according to a Trump insider, Bolton’s mustache was likely a factor in the decision.4 Here’s how the Washington Post described it.

“Presentation is very important because you’re representing America not only on the national stage but also the international stage, depending on the position,” said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller.

Several of Trump’s associates said they thought that John R. Bolton’s brush-like mustache was one of the factors that handicapped the bombastic former United Nations ambassador in the sweepstakes for secretary of state.

“Donald was not going to like that mustache,” said one associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. “I can’t think of anyone that’s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.”

Technically, my blog about Bolton’s mustache was not a prediction. But I did call out a key factor that was invisible to other observers. By then my followers on Twitter and elsewhere were already stunned at what they saw as the accuracy of my Trump-related predictions. When the Washington Post confirmed my mustache analysis as valid, brains were exploding all over the Internet. It is one thing to predict a winner in the presidential race—after all, millions of voters and a handful of pundits predicted a Trump win—but this mustache situation seemed to observers like a different level.

Let’s remind one another that sometimes a blind squirrel will find a nut. Sometimes that squirrel finds more than one nut. Maybe I just got lucky about the mustache.

Or maybe not.

## WHY I ENDORSED CLINTON (FOR MY SAFETY) UNTIL I DIDN’T

Over the course of the presidential campaign I endorsed three candidates. If you’re living in the second dimension, you might think I look like a flip-flopper with no core convictions. You have to go to the third dimension to understand why my multiple endorsements worked out the way I intended. But first I’ll need to give you some context about my own political history so you know where I’m coming from.

I don’t vote. Doing so would destroy whatever objectivity I might have. Once you join a side—for anything—it kicks your confirmation bias into overdrive. Suddenly (and it does happen fast) you start to see everything your side does as wise, while anything happening on the other side looks like stupidity and bad intentions. I minimize that particular confirmation-bias trap by not joining a political side and by not voting.

I have voted in the past. My first vote as a young man was for Jimmy Carter. In time, I came to see that vote as further evidence that the thing I call my common sense is an illusion. (Carter was a good role model but not one of our most effective presidents. He served one term.) As I got older, and more aware of my mental limitations, I came to understand that my vote adds nothing to the quality of the outcome. As far as I can tell, no one else adds intelligence to the election outcome either, but most voters think they do. And that illusion is necessary to support the government. It gives the voters a sense of empowerment and buy-in. That creates national stability. The democracy illusion is probably one of the most beneficial hallucinations humankind has ever concocted. If you think democracy works, and you act as if it works, it does work.

I think of democracy as more of a mental condition than a political system. Democracy works because we think it works, and we want it to work. But if you removed the public hallucination that an average ignorant voter has the ability to forecast the future, the whole thing would fall apart.

The democracy illusion is so robust that we can simultaneously know it is absurd while living our lives as if it were not. We all know that the vast majority of our fellow citizens are too underinformed and simpleminded to make good voting decisions. And yet there is widespread acceptance of the majority-vote system. As long as citizens buy into the illusions that they have superpredictive powers and that their votes add intelligence to the system, they will support the democratic voting process that is the foundation of the republic.

If people were rational, they would realize they don’t have the psychic powers required to distinguish between a great candidate for president and a bad one. We’re terrible at predicting the future. And voters certainly don’t understand the more complicated questions about health care, budgets, and international treaties, to name a few. But if we accepted the limitations of our own predictive abilities, we wouldn’t vote, and we wouldn’t feel as much allegiance to the country, so the whole system would fall apart.

By the way, the Pledge of Allegiance in the United States, and the tradition of singing the national anthem before big events, are examples of government-grade mind control. Those traditions have no other purpose. By the time a child is twelve years old, the state has already trained the kid to sacrifice his or her life for the flag if called to do so.

This is why I don’t speak the actual words to either the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem. I just move my lips while thinking, Blah, blah, blah. It’s probably too late to erase my early-life brainwashing, but I see no need to reinforce it. And at this point in my life, I believe (irrationally) that I am a patriot to the bone, so I don’t need more brainwashing to be a good citizen.

To be super clear, I am completely in favor of my government brainwashing its citizens, including me. The alternative would involve eventual conquest by a nation that did a better job of brainwashing its citizens.

When I was younger, I believed I could predict who would do a great job as president. But when I compare all my past expectations of new presidents with their actual performance, it is clear that I didn’t have any predictive powers. Neither do you. But you might think you do. That’s where we differ. If you have not studied persuasion in any detail, you probably hold a higher opinion of your so-called common sense than trained persuaders do.

More disclosure about my voting: I supported Bill Clinton in both of his elections, and I preferred Al Gore over George W. Bush. I can’t remember if I bothered to vote in any of those elections. But I haven’t voted in any election since.

When Gore narrowly lost to Bush, I was mildly disappointed. But I also thought Bush would be a perfectly good president who wouldn’t get the country into any big trouble. Clearly I can’t predict who will do a good job as president. Neither can anyone else. But most of us think we can.

To round out my political confessions, I’m super liberal on social matters. If something makes you happy, and it doesn’t hurt anyone else, I want you to do a lot of it. On other issues I’m a “whatever works best” kind of guy. And I usually recognize that I don’t know what works best on any complicated global issue.

Given all of that, it is no surprise that I started out by endorsing neither Clinton nor Trump for the election of 2016. I enjoyed Trump’s personality and his persuasion talents, but my political preferences didn’t align with either candidate’s stated policies. I was blissfully independent. But that didn’t last.

My blogging and tweeting about Trump’s persuasion powers made me a Trump supporter by default. I couldn’t hide my admiration for his skill set and his entertainment value. And that admiration was enough to activate the bullies and Internet trolls on Clinton’s side to come after me. And come after me they did.

The world learned during the election that Clinton’s side was spending $1 million on online operatives (more commonly referred to as trolls) to attack Trump supporters on social media. David Brock, a major Clinton supporter, created an organization called Correct the Record to act as the rabid attack dogs of social media.1


The Clinton trolls filled my Twitter feed with personal and professional insults. They tweeted embarrassing fake news stories about me. They wrote to newspapers and asked them to discontinue carrying Dilbert. They threatened my reputation and my livelihood in a variety of ways. That stuff didn’t bother me. I’m a professional. I know how to deal with critics.

But things got darker. Much darker.

Clinton supporters were doing a good job of branding Trump as Hitler. They did such a good job that perhaps a quarter of the country imagined Trump getting elected and authorizing concentration camps for illegal immigrants on day one. This is the sort of dangerous branding that can get a candidate killed. After all, if you had a chance to kill Hitler and save millions of lives, wouldn’t you have a moral obligation to do it?

That’s how bad it got. The Hitler accusations evolved from hyperbole to legitimate fear. People were literally afraid of Trump turning full Hitler on inauguration day. It was a dangerous time to be Trump, with that hanging over him. But Trump had Secret Service protection, and apparently they do a great job.

I did not have Secret Service protection. And before long, the Clinton trolls were branding me as Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda chief. The accusations were repeated often enough to start getting sticky. In my opinion (the only opinion that mattered in this case) it was a dangerous situation. People believed Trump was as bad as Hitler, and by extension that marked his alleged propaganda chief (me) for death as well.

I mean all of this literally. If you have been brainwashed to believe Hitler is coming to power, and you have a chance to kill Goebbels, you have moral authority to do it. If I believed I could kill a top Nazi and slow down Hitler’s rise, I would do it in a heartbeat. I assumed other people might feel the same way. It was a dangerous situation for me, and dangerous to any friends and family who might be around me. I decided I needed to do something to reduce the risk.

So I announced my decision to endorse Hillary Clinton, while making it clear I was only doing it for my personal safety. People laughed. They assumed I was joking. But I stuck to my endorsement, mentioning it often, and always appending “for my safety” to the end as an explanation.

I wasn’t joking. I was quite serious about trying to lower my risk.

The number of people on Twitter accusing me of being Goebbels slowed to a trickle almost immediately. In the second dimension, that outcome makes no sense. Both sides knew I wasn’t serious about being on Clinton’s team in the normal way endorsements work. But it didn’t matter. People care that you’re on their team more than they care why. My stated reason (personal safety) was completely rational, and I backed it with examples of Trump supporters being attacked in my part of the world.

Backing Clinton “for my personal safety” became a running joke on Twitter. My followers enjoyed it, and the trolls were just confused by it. The trolls never left me alone, but they backed off a lot. The endorsement worked exactly as planned. It was solid persuasion.

Here is the blog post announcing my Clinton endorsement.

Posted June 5, 2016

I’ve decided to come off the sidelines and endorse a candidate for president of the United States.

I’ll start by reminding readers that my politics don’t align with any of the candidates. My interest in the race has been limited to Trump’s extraordinary persuasion skills. But lately Hillary Clinton has moved into the persuasion game—and away from boring facts and policies—with great success. Let’s talk about that.

This past week we saw Clinton pair the idea of President Trump with nuclear disaster, racism, Hitler, the Holocaust, and whatever else makes you tremble in fear.

That is good persuasion if you can pull it off, because fear is a strong motivator. It is also a sharp pivot from Clinton’s prior approach of talking about her mastery of policy details, her experience, and her gender. Trump took her so-called woman card and turned it into a liability. So Clinton wisely pivoted. Her new scare tactics are solid-gold persuasion. I wouldn’t be surprised if you see Clinton’s numbers versus Trump improve in June, at least temporarily, until Trump finds a countermove.

The only downside I can see to the new approach is that it is likely to trigger a race war in the United States. And I would be a top-ten assassination target in that scenario, because once you define Trump as Hitler, you also give citizens moral permission to kill him. And obviously it would be okay to kill anyone who actively supports a genocidal dictator, including anyone who wrote about his persuasion skills in positive terms. (I’m called an “apologist” on Twitter, or sometimes just “Joseph Goebbels.”)

If Clinton successfully pairs Trump with Hitler in your mind—as she is doing—and loses anyway, about a quarter of the country will think it is morally justified to assassinate its own leader. I too would feel that way if an actual Hitler came to power in this country. I would join the resistance and try to remove the Hitler-like leader. You should do the same. No one wants an actual President Hitler.

So I’ve decided to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, for my personal safety. Trump supporters don’t have any bad feelings about patriotic Americans such as me, so I’ll be safe from that crowd. But Clinton supporters have convinced me—and here I am being 100 percent serious—that my safety is at risk if I am seen as supportive of Trump. So I’m taking the safe way out and endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.

As I have often said, I have no psychic powers and I don’t know which candidate would be the best president. But I do know which outcome is most likely to get me killed by my fellow citizens. So for safety reasons, I’m on team Clinton.

My prediction remains that Trump will win in a landslide based on his superior persuasion skills. But don’t blame me for anything President Trump does in office; I endorse Clinton.

The rest of you are on your own. Good luck.

### THEN I ENDORSED TRUMP

My Clinton endorsement served me well until late September of 2016, when Clinton announced plans for increasing estate taxes on the rich to what I consider confiscation levels. This was personal. I started life with almost nothing and worked seven days a week for decades to build the wealth I have now. I wasn’t in the mood to let the government decide what happens to my money when I die. Below is the blog post in which I explained my switch to endorse Trump.

Keep in mind that endorsing Trump reattracted all the risk I had successfully avoided by endorsing Clinton. But the estate tax plan made me too angry to care. I earned my money through hard work, and I already paid taxes on it. This was personal.

This was also the day I decided to move from observer to persuader. Until then I was happy to simply observe and predict. But once Clinton announced her plans to use government force to rob me on my deathbed, it was war. Persuasion war.

Here’s how I blogged it at the time.

Posted September 25, 2016

As most of you know, I had been endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, for my personal safety, because I live in California. It isn’t safe to be a Trump supporter where I live. And it’s bad for business too. But recently I switched my endorsement to Trump, and I owe you an explanation. So here it goes.

1. Things I Don’t Know: There are many things I don’t know. For example, I don’t know the best way to defeat ISIS. Neither do you. I don’t know the best way to negotiate trade policies. Neither do you. I don’t know the best tax policy to lift all boats. Neither do you. My opinion on abortion is that men should follow the lead of women on that topic because doing so produces the most credible laws. So on most political topics, I don’t know enough to make a decision. Neither do you, but you probably think you do.

Given the uncertainty about each candidate—at least in my own mind—I have been saying I am not smart enough to know who would be the best president. That neutrality changed when Clinton proposed raising estate taxes. I understand that issue and I view it as robbery by government.

I’ll say more about that, plus some other issues I do understand, below.

2. Confiscation of Property: Clinton proposed a new top Estate Tax of 65 percent on people with a net worth over $500 million. Her Web site goes to great length to obscure the actual policy details, including the fact that taxes would increase on lower-value estates as well. See the total lack of transparency here [link omitted for book], where the text simply refers to going back to 2009 rates. It is clear that the intent of the page is to mislead, not inform.

So don’t fall for the claim that Clinton has plenty of policy details on her Web site. She does, but it is organized to mislead, not to inform. That’s far worse than having no details.

The bottom line is that under Clinton’s plan, estate taxes would be higher for anyone with estates over $5 million(ish). I call this a confiscation tax because income taxes have already been paid on this money. In my case, a dollar I earn today will be taxed at about 50 percent by various government entities, collectively. With Clinton’s plan, my remaining 50 cents will be taxed again at 50 percent when I die. So the government would take 75 percent of my earnings from now on.

Yes, I can do clever things with trusts to avoid estate taxes. But that is just welfare for lawyers. If the impact of the estate tax is nothing but higher fees for my attorney and hassle for me, that isn’t good news either.

You can argue whether an estate tax is fair or unfair, but fairness is an argument for idiots and children. Fairness isn’t an objective quality of the universe. I oppose the estate tax because I was born to modest means and worked seven days a week for most of my life to be in my current position. (I’m working today, Sunday, as per usual.) And I don’t want to give 75 percent of my earnings to the government. (Would you?)

3. Party or Wake: It seems to me that Trump supporters are planning for the world’s biggest party on election night, whereas Clinton supporters seem to be preparing for a funeral. I want to be invited to the event that doesn’t involve crying and moving to Canada. (This issue isn’t my biggest reason.)

4. Clinton’s Health: To my untrained eyes and ears, Hillary Clinton doesn’t look sufficiently healthy—mentally or otherwise—to be leading the country. If you disagree, take a look at the now-famous “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead” video clip. [Note: This was the viral video clip in which a drunken-looking Clinton asked in a deranged voice, “Why aren’t I fifty points ahead?”] Likewise, Bill Clinton seems to be in bad shape too, and Hillary wouldn’t be much use to the country if she has to take care of a dying husband on the side.

5. Pacing and Leading: Trump always takes the extreme position on matters of safety and security for the country, even if those positions are unconstitutional, impractical, evil, or something that the military would refuse to do. Normal people see this as a dangerous situation. Trained persuaders such as I see this as something called pacing and leading. Trump “paces” the public—meaning he matches them in their emotional state. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest badass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump looks scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency. That’s how I see him.

So when Clinton supporters ask me how I could support a “fascist,” the answer is that he isn’t one. Clinton’s team, with the help of Godzilla, have effectively persuaded the public to see Trump as scary. The persuasion works because Trump’s “pacing” system is not obvious to the public. They see his “first offers” as evidence of evil. They are not. They are technique.

And being chummy with Putin is more likely to keep us safe, whether you find that distasteful or not. Clinton wants to insult Putin into doing what we want. That approach seems dangerous as hell to me.

6. Persuasion: Economies are driven by psychology. If you expect things to go well tomorrow, you invest today, which causes things to go well tomorrow, as long as others are doing the same. The best kind of president for managing the psychology of citizens—and therefore the economy—is a trained persuader. You can call that persuader a con man, a snake oil salesman, a carnival barker, or full of shit. It’s all persuasion. And Trump simply does it better than I have ever seen anyone do it.

The battle with ISIS is also a persuasion problem. The entire purpose of military action against ISIS is to persuade them to stop, not to kill every single one of them. We need military-grade persuasion to get at the root of the problem. Trump understands persuasion, so he is likely to put more emphasis in that area.

Most of the job of president is persuasion. Presidents don’t need to understand policy minutiae. They need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. You can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far.

In summary, I don’t understand the policy details and implications of the bulk of either Trump’s or Clinton’s proposed ideas. Neither do you. But I do understand persuasion. I also understand when the government is planning to confiscate the majority of my assets. And I can also distinguish between a deeply unhealthy person and a healthy person, even though I have no medical training. (So can you.)

As you might expect, Trump supporters were happy to see me endorse their candidate. I was all in. I was on the Trump team now, for better or worse.

It didn’t take long for worse to happen. And you can’t get much worse than what happened next.

### WHY I BRIEFLY ENDORSED GARY JOHNSON

On October 7, 2016, the Washington Post broke the story of a lewd private conversation between Trump and Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, caught on a hot microphone. It was devastating.

Persuasion-wise, this had everything. It had audio. It had video. It had sex. It had shock. It was relevant. And it was powerful. As soon as I heard the audio clip, I realized it was a bad idea to associate my brand with Trump. When the scandal broke, Trump was instantly toxic, bordering on radioactive. As women came forward with claims of unwanted advances, I decided to put some distance between Trump’s problems and my blogging.

I had already tainted my reputation quite a bit by endorsing Trump. I had trashed my income at the same time, as my speaking career went from thriving to zero. I thought I knew what I was getting into. But I didn’t see the so-called Pussygate scandal coming, with its full audio and visual persuasion. This stain wasn’t going to wear off. It looked like the end for Trump. The Persuasion Filter can’t predict scandals that come out of nowhere.

I decided to put some distance between my brand and Trump’s. And so I endorsed third-party candidate Gary Johnson for president. The reason I offered was that Gary Johnson is the kind of candidate who touches only himself. Here’s how I explained it at the time.

Posted October 9, 2016

I don’t know how to write this post without unintentionally disrespecting the real victims of abuse in any form. I apologize in advance if it comes off that way. But it’s part of the national conversation now, and unavoidable. The best I can do is focus on how voters perceive the situation. I don’t have an opinion about who did what to whom because I wasn’t in the room any of those times. That said . . .

We fine citizens of the United States find ourselves playing some sort of sex-abuse poker in which we have to assign value to various alleged sex crimes to see which alleged rapist/groper/enabler combination we want to inhabit the White House and represent our national brand. Let’s call that situation “not ideal.”

My view is that if either Clinton or Trump can be judged by the weight of the allegations against them, both are 100 percent unfit for the office. I think Trump supporters think it’s worth the hit to our national brand just to get some specific improvements in the country.

Clinton supporters have been telling me for a few days that any visible support for Trump makes you a supporter of sex abuse. From a persuasion standpoint, that actually makes sense. If people see it that way, that’s the reality you have to deal with. I choose to not be part of that reality, so I moved my endorsement to Gary Johnson.

I encourage all Clinton supporters to do the same, and for the same reason. I don’t know if any of the allegations against the Clintons are true, but since we are judging one another on associations, you don’t want to be seen as supporting sex abuse by putting an alleged duo of abusers (the perp and the cleanup crew) into office. I think you will agree that it doesn’t matter if any of the allegations are true, because the stink from a mountain of allegations—many that seem credible to observers—is bad for the national brand too. To even consider putting the Clintons back in the White House is an insult to women and every survivor of abuse.

To be fair, Gary Johnson is a pothead who didn’t know what Aleppo was. [Note: A reporter asked Johnson about Aleppo, a hot spot in the Syrian conflict, and Johnson didn’t recognize the name of the city.] I call that relatable. A President Gary Johnson administration might bring with it some operational risks, and policy risks, but at least he won’t slime you by association and turn you into some sort of cheerleader for sex abuse in the way you would if you voted for the Clintons or Trump.

If you take allegations of sex abuse seriously—and you should—vote Johnson. To vote for Clinton or Trump is to be seen by others as an enabler of sexual abuse. I don’t think that’s what anyone had in mind by breaking the glass ceiling. Don’t let it happen to you.

At this point in our story, with only a few weeks before the election, I had lost confidence in my prediction of a Trump win. It seemed that my future would involve losing whatever credibility I had and becoming a laughingstock for years. If history can be our guide, I knew it would take ten minutes for some stranger to update my Wikipedia page so the world would forever know just how wrong I had been, with dates and details and links to unflattering articles about me that would be written by the winning pundits.

Things didn’t look good for me. Things looked worse for Trump.

Any person with a normal sense of embarrassment would have reversed his prediction to match the pollsters and the experts. That person would have disavowed Trump in a public way. There was still time to salvage some scraps of dignity.

That’s not how I played it.

### WHY I RE-ENDORSED TRUMP IN THE END

“We got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies.”

—Actress Zoe Saldana, one week before President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017

I live in northern California, a short drive from Berkeley. It’s a liberal place. Trump didn’t even bother to campaign in California beyond the minimum. In normal years it is uncomfortable to be a Republican supporter of any type living in northern California. But this was no normal year.

Clinton’s team did a great job of framing Trump as a dangerous and unstable Hitler-in-the-making. As I noted before, that provided moral cover for her supporters to threaten and physically assault Trump supporters in public.

I’ll pause here to stipulate that Trump supporters also caused some trouble. But we learned that much of what was reported as Trump supporters starting trouble turned out to be outright hoaxes, or fights instigated by paid Clinton operatives.

There was the undercover video by Project Veritas that featured Clinton operatives bragging about instigating violence at Trump rallies.2

There was the arson of what the media called a “historic black church” that was reported as a suspected hate crime perpetrated by Trump supporters. The real perpetrator turned out to be an African American member of the church.3

There was the Muslim woman who claimed she was accosted on a subway by three Trump supporters, but it turned out to be a lie.4

We don’t need to compare assault rates to know that some Clinton supporters and some Trump supporters crossed the line. Let’s agree to not make it a competition. Every large group includes some bad people.

For me personally, Trump supporters were not dangerous because they considered me to be on their side. And I saw no signs of them starting fights with people who were minding their own business. Clinton supporters were another story, and we knew by then that they could be violent. Some examples:

At a Trump rally in San Jose (a short drive from my home), Clinton supporters physically attacked Trump supporters leaving the rally.5

Trump supporters were attacked after a Richmond rally.6

A Trump supporter was attacked outside a Burlingame rally.7

On election day a female Trump supporter was attacked at a Florida polling station.8

The mainstream media appeared to be largely ignoring these attacks. But that might have been my own confirmation bias. It didn’t take too many similar-looking acts of violence to convince me that there was a pattern here, and a real danger that could get worse.

On Twitter—the Wild West of social media—the bullying from Clinton supporters was relentless. They insulted my appearance, my intelligence, my age, my sexual prowess, my relationships, my height, my baldness—you name it. If it was evil, someone said it to me that year. Probably more than once.

I have a hot button that makes me irrational when I see or experience bullying. I probably could have lived with the bullying and threats if I had been the only target. But Trump supporters all over the country were being assaulted. I heard dozens of stories from victims. I heard stories of people losing customers, losing jobs, being taunted and attacked in public, and having their cars and homes vandalized. This was not politics. This was bully behavior, simple and plain. And it flipped a bit in my brain that I couldn’t flip back.

Like many of you, I had some bully issues when I was a kid. I solved my bully problems through a prudent application of public violence, as was the custom in those days in small towns. Oddly enough, I didn’t go to jail. That was also the custom in those days. Attacking a bully in a public place wasn’t considered bad behavior. It was considered the solution to the problem. That upbringing is still in me.

Summary: I don’t like bullies.

Trump was in a huge hole with the Access Hollywood scandal, and it got worse with the parade of women who came forward to make claims against him. It seemed that the bullies were going to win. That situation was unbearable to me.

If any anti-Trumpers are reading this book, you are probably scoffing because you consider Trump the only bully in the story. That point of view is what I call word-thinking. But for our purposes here, I’ll simply say Trump wasn’t bullying me. And he wasn’t bullying any American citizens who were minding their own business. But he sure did go hard at any opponents who were foolish enough to get into the cage fight with him. I think it makes a difference whom you are bullying. I wasn’t alarmed when Trump went hard at professional critics. But when someone comes for me personally, or for other citizens, the small-town reflex in me takes over.

I already had a problem with Hillary Clinton trying to rob my estate after I died. Now I also wanted to destroy the entire Democratic Party and all of its “politically correct” Nazi-labeling bullies. I rarely use my persuasion skills at full strength. I only do so in the context of a fight, or for some greater good. This was both.

You need not remind me that Trump supporters on the Internet were also terrible bullies in many cases. But this is my story, and they weren’t coming after me. They were mostly coming after the Clinton bullies, who considered Trump supporters to have less value than other classes of people. I wasn’t comfortable with the bullying on either side. But I cared more about the bullies who were coming after me.

On October 25, 2016, I re-endorsed Donald Trump for president of the United States. He has his flaws. But he wasn’t bullying me and he wasn’t trying to rob my estate. By now my lucrative speaking career had dropped from one or two offers per week to zero. In twenty years, that had never happened. My Trump association had gutted a major part of my income and turned me into a pariah. By election day I had lost 75 percent of my so-called friends, several of whom turned out to be bullies too.

As a trained persuader, I prefer not to join any kind of tribe. Doing so triggers an automatic bias toward tribe opinion and blinds one to better thinking. It also marks you as an enemy to competing tribes. Candidate Trump probably got some political advantage by once being a Democrat, later a Republican, and only barely a conservative. He was clearly in the Republican tribe for political purposes, but in our minds he was more like an individual force of nature than a member of a tribe. Our collective impression of Trump’s independent thinking probably made it easier for some people to cross party lines and support him. If you want to see the world more clearly, avoid joining a tribe. But if you are going to war, leave your clear thinking behind and join a tribe. Trump joined the Republican tribe to win the presidency. Now I was joining the Trump tribe.

For a war against Hillbullies.

I was all in.

## THE THIRD ACT

Iwas one of the most optimistic of all the pro-Trump public figures. And even I hit bottom after hearing Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” comment. I was out of the country when it all went down, and not paying attention to the news. When I finally checked my phone, my Twitter feed was lighting up. I could see the frenzy before I knew what it was about. All I knew was that it was some kind of bad news for candidate Trump, and his supporters were asking me to reassure them he could still win.

No problem, I figured. Trump gets in trouble once a week. Then he gets out of it. I had seen it so many times that it seemed routine. And so this new scandal—whatever it was—would surely be more of the same. The cryptic mentions on Twitter referred to some sort of audio recording of Trump saying inappropriate things about women.

How bad could it be?

No problem, I figured. Trump says five inappropriate things before breakfast. Surely this is no big deal. By this point in the election story, I had taught my Twitter followers to distinguish a big deal from a little deal, at least in terms of persuasion. I was a bit miffed that—as far as I could tell—they had forgotten how to do it. I figured I would click on the link that everyone was frantically sending me, read it, put it in context, and tell the world via my blog post that it was no big deal, as I had done so many times in the past year.

I clicked the link. I listened to the audio.

I felt my stomach fall through the floor.

Trump was finished, or so it seemed. And so was I. I figured he would go on to enjoy the fabulous life of a billionaire grandfather, and I would live under a cloud of Trump-related humiliation for the rest of my life. This sort of conspicuous failure doesn’t wash off. It seemed to be the worst-case scenario.

As you already know, I rapidly switched my endorsement from Trump to Gary Johnson, just to stay out of the blast zone.

But this is where things get interesting. And by “interesting” I mean spooky.

I had been predicting in my blog since the autumn of 2015 that Trump would end up following a classic three-act movie structure before winning. The three-act form looks like this:

First Act: The hero experiences something life changing. In Trump’s case, it meant running for president and getting an early lead.

Second Act: In the second act we see the hero having fun, and usually winning, with one minor adventure after another. We watched Trump romp through the Republican primaries, overcoming one obstacle after another, in a surprising and entertaining fashion, just like a proper movie.

The first and second acts often hint at a major problem to come. Trump had overcome one scandalous accusation after another, as you would expect in a second act. But you also had to wonder if something big was ahead. Something terrible. Something that even Trump could not escape. It isn’t a good movie unless that happens. And when it comes, we call it the third act.

Third Act: The third and final act is characterized by an impossible-to-solve problem that the hero manages to solve anyway. But don’t be fooled by the “fake third acts” earlier in the movie. In the first and second acts, the hero also has hard-to-solve problems. But they pale in comparison with the real third-act problem.

If the movie is written well, the audience will be fooled into thinking that at least one of the second-act problems is really the big third-act problem. For example, it looked as though Trump might be toast after his slow denial of the KKK on CNN, which he attributed to a faulty audio connection. And it looked as if he might be finished when he got tricked into allegedly “insulting” the Khans, the parents of a fallen hero, after their participation in the Democratic convention. In hindsight, those hiccups look like fake third acts.

The “real” third act was the Access Hollywood audio leak. No one survives that kind of scandal. Not even Trump. Especially when election day is only a month away. Trump was in an impossible spot. Polls said he had something like a 2 percent chance of winning before the scandal even broke.

By the time Pussygate became the headline story, I had on many occasions discussed my three-act-movie prediction, both on social media and in my blog. That prediction didn’t get a lot of attention because it was frankly weird. I offered no basis for my prediction, teasing my social media followers that I would reveal the secret behind the prediction right after the third act happened and Trump won the election. After the win, I explained it this way on my blog.

Posted November 9, 2016

How did I predict the election would turn out so movie perfect? I saw the following situation developing:

1. The social bullying coming from Clinton’s supporters guaranteed that lots of Trump supporters were in hiding. That created the potential for a surprise result, so long as the race was close.

2. Trump’s powers of persuasion are better than I have ever seen from a living human. That made it likely that the election would be close. And people generally vote for their party’s candidate, so that too promised a close election.

3. The mainstream media backed Clinton. That created a situation in which she was likely to be ahead at some point near the end of the election cycle.

4. The business model of the news industry guarantees lots of “scandals” on a regular schedule. Small things get inflated to big things, and I assumed there would be plenty of them. Trump has the skill to overcome medium-sized scandals and bumps in the road. That’s all you need for an entertaining second act.

5. Once I framed this election as a movie script, it primed you to see events that way. Our brains are movie-trained to recognize the three-act form. That’s why all movies use it.

That’s how I explained my three-act-movie prediction at the time. But it wasn’t a complete answer. I saved the spooky parts for this book. But first I have to put it in context.

Keep in mind that my main point of this book is that humans do not see reality as it exists. We didn’t evolve to have that capability. What we do have is the ability to rationalize our observations and wrap them into little movies about reality that we create in our minds.

Remember also that there is no way to know if any of our movies is the “right” one, if such a thing even exists. All we can know for sure is that the filter we pick for reality makes us happy, or it doesn’t, and it predicts the future well, or it doesn’t. That’s all we know.

According to the Persuasion Filter, several movies could be running at the same time, on the same screen, and doing good jobs of keeping their viewers happy and predicting what happens next. But what if several completely different movies all had the same ending? Would that mean something?

I have been seeing the world in this multiple-movie way for many years. When Trump started getting traction in the election, several movies popped into my mind. But here’s the spooky part.

They were all different movies except for the endings: Trump won in every movie.

And that was unusual.

I’ll summarize the crazy (perhaps literally) movies I was watching in my head.

The Scott’s-Destiny Movie: One of the movies in my head has a spooky script in which I sometimes literally see the future. These “visions,” for lack of a less magical-sounding word, happen while I am awake, arrive on their own schedule, and don’t fade in memory the way dreams do. In fact, they get stronger over time. And they have a distinct character that feels like neither memory nor imagination. I thought they were just my imagination until I started noticing them coming true. (Yes, each case might have been confirmation bias on my part. That doesn’t matter to this point.) I’ll tell you about a few of my so-called visions, just to give you an idea what that movie looks like.

When I was about six years old, I saw myself becoming a world-famous cartoonist. It didn’t feel like wishful thinking. It felt like something else. My experience of it was that I could see my fate. And it played out pretty much the way I saw it when I was six. I don’t have to tell you how rare it is to become a famous cartoonist.

One day in college, I suddenly awoke from a sound sleep with my head full of visions of San Francisco, a place in which I had no family and no connections and for which I had no special affection. A year later, I was living in San Francisco, thanks to at least three unrelated coincidences. I still live in the Bay Area.

On another day in college, I awoke with a vision of myself onstage giving a speech to an indoor crowd of thousands. Years later, I became one of the highest-paid professional speakers in the country, talking to packed ballrooms and theaters all over the country. At the time of the vision, I had no ambitions of being on an actual stage for any reason whatsoever. The idea seemed to come from nowhere.

Those are the so-called visions I can tell you about. I’ve had this sensation of seeing glimpses of the future perhaps a dozen times. And my unreliable memory tells me each of them came true except for one scheduled for the upcoming five years. Inhabitants of the 2-D world will be quick to note that the most likely explanation of this phenomenon is that I’m lying, or I have selective memory. Those movies are playing on the same screen as my movie, and I don’t disparage them. But all of the movies I was watching showed Donald J. Trump becoming president of the United States, against all odds. I could see that future as clearly as my own hand. That doesn’t mean I was really seeing the future. I don’t believe people can see the future. I’m just telling you my subjective experience of it.

By the way, I have in the past made plenty of wrong predictions about all sorts of things. But in those cases, the predictions arose from some combination of 2-D analysis, wishful thinking, and ordinary guessing. My experience of predicting Trump’s win was entirely different. My experience of it was that I could “see” it happening in a way that didn’t feel like imagination.

To be perfectly clear, if I heard the story I am telling you right now from someone else, I wouldn’t believe a word of it. I would assume I was hearing either lies or the result of selective memory. You are welcome to do the same. Remember, I am not presenting this movie as reality, or anything close to it. I’m presenting it as a rationalization of my experiences, the same way all of the movies in our heads are formed. If the movie in my head makes me happy, and it predicts the future, that’s all I ask of it. This particular movie did make me happy, simply because I find Trump entertaining. And it did predict the future. Good enough.

But this wasn’t the only movie in my head that showed Trump winning. There were more. The additional movies are what made this situation spooky.

The Simulated-Reality Movie: In this movie, an earlier species created humans as some sort of software simulation. We believe we are as real as our creators, but there could be billions of simulations for every original species, assuming that every simulation eventually learns to create its own simulations, and so on. In this movie, a lot of computer programming code gets reused for the sake of efficiency, and that’s why we see patterns in life where none should exist. In this Trump movie, we are seeing code reuse.

When I noticed that Trump’s first act in the primaries was turning into a second act, it made me wonder if this was a case of code reuse in a simulated universe. The three-act-movie form is one of our most common patterns. Trump’s first and second acts were so movie perfect that my mind reflexively filled in the third act with his win. This filter on reality assumes that the three-act-movie structure not only happens in our scripted entertainment but is also a recurring pattern that we see in our lives in general. It’s a satisfying pattern because it predicts that the hero will come from behind to win.

I’ll remind you that I’m not selling this version of reality as true. It is just one of many filters on the world that has the capacity to make me happy. And as you can see, it did a good job of predicting the future in this case.

The Scott-Persuasion Movie: In this movie, I caused Trump’s election through my own powers of persuasion. This movie made me happy because I was the hero of it (or the villain if you are a Clinton supporter), and it did a good job of predicting too. I don’t hold this movie to be true. It just happens to fit the observed data, exactly like all of the other movies.

The Master-Persuader Movie: In this movie, Trump’s world-class persuasion talents take everyone by surprise. In this script, I am an observer who chronicles Trump’s persuasion moves, almost like a narrator. This movie became my primary filter on the election, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it for over a year. The script made me happy, and it predicted a Trump win.

The Bully Movie: In this movie, the so-called social justice warriors supporting Clinton are the bullies who don’t know they are bullies. If you have ever seen a movie about a bully, you know the bully has to lose in the end. I love a good bully movie where the victims rise up and prevail against all odds. That sort of story makes me happy. And this movie plot also predicted Trump’s win.

As I am sure you know, millions of people were watching a different movie in which Trump was the only bully in the story. I doubt that movie made anyone happy, especially after he won. And it certainly didn’t predict well.

The Scott-Wins-from-Behind Movie: I have a wonderful recurring pattern in my life that involves coming from behind to win in a variety of situations. It seems to happen to me with surprising regularity in sports, board games, business, and lots of other realms. You don’t need to tell me this is a case of selective memory because that’s what it feels like to me as well. The net effect of this observed or imagined pattern is the sense that no matter how deep the hole, I’ll win in the end.

Like most people, I’ve failed at lots of things. I wrote a whole book about my many failures. But the failures rarely involved getting any serious traction in the first place. The coming-from-behind pattern has been limited to situations in which I’m well into the game but behind the leaders.

When election day came, my win-from-behind movie came to dominate my mind as I watched the news coverage of the results. I was supposed to lose to the other pundits who had predicted a solid Clinton win. The pollsters said I was going to lose. My optimism had for a time taken a serious beating by Pussygate. On Twitter, my harshest critics left messages gloating in advance at the humiliating defeat they expected me to experience. Several said they were looking forward to watching me drown in my tears after the election. They promised to visit my Twitter feed for that pleasure alone. It was the perfect movie setup for me to come from behind and win.

And then I did.

## WAS I PREDICTING OR CAUSING?

When you are first exposed to the idea of “filters” on reality, it can be hard to fully embrace the idea. The most challenging part is acknowledging that the human mind is not equipped to understand reality in any deep way. Instead, we create little movies in our minds, and we live in those movies until events in the observable world make that impossible. When our current movie fails, we subconsciously call for a mental rewrite of the script, and our movie changes to fit the observed facts. In this chapter I’ll describe a fun example in which two filters explain the same observations. Once you start to recognize this phenomenon, you’ll see it all over. I’ll prime you with this example.

One of the most interesting questions about Trump’s “unexpected” election victory is whether I was simply predicting it or actually causing it (in some small way) with my own persuasion. I realize it sounds absurd to think I was manipulating world events just by typing on my laptop in my kitchen, as I am right now. But let me make the case for it anyway, just so you can see how easily two different filters can describe the same observations.

The only reason I mention the Scott-caused-it filter at all is because my Twitter and blog followers started to wonder if I was doing more than predicting. They wondered if I was actively working for the campaign because it seemed to them that Trump kept making the moves I was predicting. For example, when Trump was being accused of being a heartless monster, I suggested in my blog that he should do something compassionate on camera. I admit this was an obvious move. But it hadn’t been done yet, and it had been obvious for some time. The very next day, candidate Trump went into the audience to get personal and touchy with a wounded veteran. The video went viral on social media. My Twitter followers wondered if the timing was a coincidence.

When Clinton secured the Democratic nomination and started painting Trump as a racist, I blogged that the most persuasive defense to that charge was to be physically affectionate with African Americans on camera. A real racist can’t fake physical affection and wouldn’t even try.

As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, twenty-four hours after writing that blog post, I started getting excited tweets from people saying versions of “He’s doing it! He’s touching black people on camera!” And so he was. He was kissing a black baby, hugging black adults, and generally being physically affectionate. It wasn’t enough to solve his problem—or even close—but it was a step in the right direction.

Lots of pundits had accurate predictions about the election. A normal distribution of luck guaranteed that someone was going to be more accurate than the average. If you think I got lucky with my Trump-related predictions, and that is all that happened, your filter on reality fits the data perfectly. Someone was going to be right, and you know from experience that such a person was going to later claim he or she had special insight. That’s exactly what I did. So did the other pundits who predicted Trump’s win. Perhaps we got “lucky” and tried to frame it as skill. That view of the world fits every observable fact.

Likewise, if you think this was a situation of confirmation bias—in which people only imagined that my predictions matched reality—and perhaps they were ignoring the misses and overinterpreting the hits—that filter on the situation also fits perfectly.

Now we have four viable filters for our observations. One filter says I simply guessed who would become president and got lucky. Another filter says I wasn’t accurate at all, but confirmation bias makes it seem as though I was. The third filter says I was accurately predicting the election because my background in persuasion gave me special insight into the situation. The fourth filter says I was causing the election outcome, not predicting it. The interesting thing is that all four filters fit the observable data. That means you will probably never know which—if any—of those filters is right.

Neither will I.

For fun and education only, let’s compare the “lucky guess” filter to the idea that I was influencing the election and not simply predicting.

Keep in mind that I’m a trained persuader and a professional writer. Objectively speaking, my opinions will usually be more persuasive than the opinions you see from people with less training. Training makes you better at most skills, and persuasion is no different. I’ve been training in the combined arts of writing and persuasion for about forty years. You should expect me to be far more persuasive than the average pundit, based on practice alone.

During the election, my blog traffic shot up. I was reaching over 100,000 followers with every tweet and blog post. That’s a lot when you consider that not many people pay attention to politics at any deep level, especially early in the race. The 100,000 people who saw my early blog posts about Trump were among the people who cared most about politics. These were the voters who followed every interesting angle. Influencing this group would, in theory, have a multiplier effect as they influenced others. When something I wrote went viral—which happened a number of times—millions of people saw my unique framing of issues. Nearly every major media site contacted me during the election and said it was reading my blog. Usually this was in the context of inviting me for an interview or asking for a quote. But many of the contacts were from people in the news business telling me they were fans of my blog and that my Persuasion Filter on the race was the talk of their office.

In the months before election day I heard reliable reports that some members of the Trump campaign staff were aware of my blogging about their boss. Donald Trump Jr. followed me on Twitter and retweeted my work a few times. Candidate Trump retweeted me once. And Trump supporter Newt Gingrich referred to my blog in a published article. I had become hard to ignore. But I have no way to evaluate my impact on anyone’s thinking.

I had an emotional reason to try to influence the election because the Hillbullies had triggered me. I don’t like bullies. And being human, I also wanted my prediction to be right. So I had good reasons to want to persuade. I was motivated.

Putting all of this in courtroom terms, I had the motivation to persuade, the opportunity, and the right tools for the job. And on election day, events went in the direction I was persuading.

But none of that means I changed any minds.

It is easy to fit the facts to the past in a way that supports a number of theories. As CNN showed us, and I explained in the Cognitive Dissonance chapter, there were dozens of expert explanations for Trump’s win, and all of them fit the observed facts. All I’ve done is add one more example of how you can fit the observed data to different interpretations of the past. You might wonder how anyone could pick the most accurate explanation out of all of those possibilities.

The answer is that we don’t have any reliable way to do that.

But just for fun, I have a little trick I use to trace the impact of my persuasion. The method certainly isn’t foolproof, and it is more entertainment than science. But in the interest of painting a complete picture here, I’ll tell you how I do it: I use uncommon words and ideas and see if they enter the public conversation. If I see my unique wording or uncommon framing suddenly leap into widespread use, that means I probably made a dent in the universe. But you can never rule out coincidence.


For example, early in the election cycle, when most pundits were describing Trump as some kind of evil clown, I was using words such as persuasion, anchors, hypnosis, framing, and negotiation. By inauguration day, those words had become common in the political press.

Moments ago I was doing a live stream on Periscope and asked my longtime readers if they thought I was the first public person to bluntly say in 2015 that facts don’t matter when it comes to picking a president. My audience on Periscope unanimously agreed that they heard it from me first. And they also agreed that other publications started mimicking my writing with science-based articles about how humans are irrational in their decision making. It turns out that science agrees with hypnotists: Humans only imagine that facts matter to our decisions. The reality is that we are inventing our own personal facts to fit the movies playing in our heads.

To be fair, I can’t rule out the hypothesis that my readers only imagined I was the first writer to loudly declare that the facts wouldn’t matter in the election. This could be a case of confirmation bias. And the same applies for the next “tell.”

In 2015 I started using the metaphor that Trump was playing three-dimensional chess against two-dimensional players. The third dimension, according to my framing, is persuasion. I hadn’t heard anyone use that metaphor for Trump until I did. A year later you would see it used by Trump supporters and critics alike. The critics used it in the negative, as in “I doubt he’s playing 4-D chess. We just think he’s incompetent.” (The critics usually escalated my 3-D to a higher number for sarcastic effect.)


It is entirely possible that other writers independently realized that facts don’t matter in this election because they witnessed it happening. It is also possible that other writers thought of the 3-D chess metaphor on their own. It is a common way to describe higher-level strategy.

Pulling together all of the clues, we know that I am trained in the ways of persuasion, I had a clear motive to persuade voters, I tried hard to persuade, and I had an open channel via social media to the people I wanted to persuade. We also know the outcome turned out to be the one I tried to create. And you can see signs of my nonstandard language choices entering the national conversation.

But all of that proves nothing. Nor is it compelling circumstantial evidence.

As I keep saying—because repetition of this point is useful—you can force-fit lots of different interpretations to the past, and they all work. I know at least three people who believe they were the key reason Trump won. And they all have strong claims.

The reality is that Trump’s victory probably required all the help it could get from every source of luck and talent available. I can say with confidence that I swayed some votes because I asked on Twitter how many people decided to vote for Trump because of something I said. Thousands of respondents claimed I was the reason they voted the way they did. The Twitter poll only reached a tiny fraction of the people who were exposed to my Trump persuasion. That means I might have moved tens of thousands of votes. Maybe hundreds of thousands. There’s no way to know.

> PERSUASION TIP 31
> If you are trying to get a decision from someone who is on the fence but leaning in your direction, try a “fake because” to give them “permission” to agree with you. The reason you offer doesn’t need to be a good one. Any “fake because” will work when people are looking for a reason to move your way.

But I do know I supplied a lot of what I call “fake because” persuasion. In this case, that means people were already primed to vote for Trump, but they didn’t want to commit to it, either mentally or otherwise, because the anti-Trumpers did such a good job of painting Trump as Hitler. My framing of Trump as a Master Persuader and not a dictatorial clown gave people a type of psychological cover—permission, if you will—to vote for Trump. I heard from several dozen people over social media that they used my arguments to defend their choices. On the surface, it looks as if I persuaded them. But the “fake because” can be misleading. If I hadn’t provided a good “because” that they could use to justify their votes, they would have chosen some other “because.” They would have latched onto whatever was the latest news report and declared that the new information was the last straw that turned them to Trump. The people who were leaning toward Trump but not committing were probably going to commit by election day no matter what. People just needed to find their “fake because” to rationalize it. I provided an acceptable “because” in the form of the Master Persuader concept.

Now let’s add some context to my movie. If you really want to know how persuasive I was in the election, it might help to know about my track record for this sort of thing. I can’t fully disclose my persuasion projects from the past. All I can tell you is that this isn’t the first time a national event went my way. However, there is no way to know how much influence, if any, I had in those cases either. Perhaps I am just good at predicting the winning side. It would look the same to observers. And I wouldn’t know the underlying truth either, at least not with certainty.

My best guess about my own persuasion is that I did influence a lot of people to change their votes. But I think the Persuasion Filter also did a good job of predicting events during the election. So I think my actions during the election were a mixture of causing and predicting. I don’t know which one explains more of what happened.

At the time of this writing I am trying to influence another national topic: climate science. My framing involves separating the science from the prediction models, and the prediction models from the economic models, and evaluating each of them separately. After all, economics is not science. Economics is more like astrology, at least when you’re predicting ten years out.

This framing of climate science is not unique to me, but at this writing almost everyone expressing an opinion on climate change says it is either a looming disaster or nothing to worry about. I’m reframing it as three separate topics: the science, the climate models, and the economic models. If you see that framing become the standard way of looking at climate science by the time you read this book, it might be because of my influence.

But we can’t know for sure.


Update: A few months after I wrote this chapter, President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord, framing it as an economic decision that is independent from the science. President Trump’s critics twitched and stomped their feet for a few weeks, until they realized how hard it was to argue in favor of spending billions of dollars for nearly no reduction in global temperatures. When experts confirmed the high cost and low impact of the agreement, I realized I had just witnessed one of the greatest High-Ground Maneuvers in modern history.

Or I caused it.

It all looks the same.

Bonus: Look for a clue in this tweet that the author of the book Pre-Suasion, Robert Cialdini, is familiar with my work.


The use of “Master Persuader” in the ad could be a coincidence. But the author did once tell me he enjoyed reading my blog posts about the election. Does it seem that I persuaded Robert Cialdini, one of the most famous experts on persuasion of all time?

Maybe.

But another movie on the same screen says Cialdini persuaded me to include an ad for his excellent book in my book.

Damn it! He’s good.

## ELECTION NIGHT
November 8, 2016.

I had been living a very public life for the past year—more so than usual. During an election cycle, the media is starving for content, and my Master Persuader idea offered something different to help fill the endless minutes. Producers invited me to explain my thoughts about Trump on cable news shows, national radio, print interviews, podcasts, Twitter, Periscope live streams, and more. My thoughts on the election were being retweeted, reposted, quoted, and flat-out stolen by other authors and pundits. But on election day, all I felt was alone. Before the night was over, I would either be a laughingstock for the rest of my life or an unexpected winner of spooky proportions. One way or another, things were about to change for me, and bigly.

I invited my girlfriend, Kristina Basham, to join me to watch the election results come in. Early in the day, the pollsters and the TV experts with their electoral-map projections reminded me every few minutes that I was about to have a bad night, and maybe a bad future.

I had been telling people by social media since the time of Pussygate that I was sticking with my prediction of a 98 percent chance that Trump would win. And by election day, I had moved my endorsement from Gary Johnson back to Trump. I was all in. And I was in a deep hole, just like Trump. For better or worse, my fate was connected to his. And according to just about everyone on television that night, Trump’s fate was not looking good.

But a funny thing happened when Florida started reporting votes: All of the movies in my head were still predicting a Trump win. And my optimism returned in force. At this point, my come-from-behind movie was the most dominant of the competing scripts in my mind. Florida was a must-win state for Trump, and when he pulled ahead in the early vote count, I tweeted a one-letter message to my followers.

My Twitter feed lit up with people asking what I meant by that one letter. I didn’t respond to the questions. When Florida looked like it would be a Trump win, I tweeted a second letter.

Even with Florida coming in for Trump, the experts still predicted a comfortable Clinton victory. I wasn’t having any of it. I tweeted another letter.

Several of my clever followers on Twitter now had enough clues to solve the puzzle. I had been predicting a Trump “landslide” for a year, against all odds. Now I was spelling it out in real time, as the election unfolded. And I was wa-a-a-a-y over my skis. I wasn’t in a mood to die timid that night.

My twitter feed started going crazy. Most of my followers were Trump supporters, and the mainstream media had by then crushed their optimism. When they saw my early optimism about the vote results, their optimism returned too, as some later told me. Remember, I had been pacing them for a year. Now I was leading with my own optimism, and they followed. I had been right about many things that year, and they hoped I had one more good prediction in me. I could almost feel the electricity in their comments.

You know the rest of the story.

Trump won some states he wasn’t supposed to win, and I completed my “L-A-N-D-S-L-I-D-E” prediction in one more tweet. Trump lost the popular vote, but he won the Electoral College by a solid margin that his supporters called a “landslide” and his critics called “losing the popular vote.”

Maybe Trump won because he campaigned better in the right states. Maybe there were more so-called shy Trump supporters than the experts believed. Maybe Trump won because of any one of CNN’s twenty-four listed reasons for his win, published soon afterward. Maybe it was because one of the movies in my head is the “real” one. I will never know.

At about midnight, with Trump’s election in the bag, I decided to celebrate by enjoying a large amount of California’s finest medical marijuana—legally, I might add. On any normal evening I would not consume so much. But this was no ordinary night. Kristina had headed home, and I was alone with my wonderful movies—all of them, replaying in my head. I slipped into bed and expected to be blissfully asleep in minutes. I had avoided the abyss. I was experiencing pure joy.

My phone rang.

A British voice cheerfully greeted me and announced that it was the BBC calling. I had forgotten that I had agreed to take their call on election night to do a live radio interview about the outcome. This was the call. And my brain was on Jupiter.

I had two choices. I could refuse to do the interview that I had promised I would do, or I could thoroughly embarrass myself to the BBC audience all over the world.

Of course I did the interview. That wasn’t even a hard choice.

It was one of the best days of my life.

I should remind you once again that my support for Trump was not about his policies. Much will have transpired by the time you read this book. Perhaps President Trump will go on to do great things. Or maybe not. But no matter where fate leads us, you now have a new filter for viewing your experience of reality.

Welcome to the third dimension.
