# PART 4 HOW TO USE PERSUASION IN BUSINESS AND POLITICS

## HOW TO DESIGN A LINGUISTIC KILL SHOT
Over the course of the election we saw Trump assign one sticky nickname after another to his opponents. It seemed as if each new nickname was a winner. Clinton’s team tried a few nicknames for Trump, but they failed. Badly. None of this is a coincidence. Trump’s nicknames were deeply engineered and then tested in front of live audiences. Here are some of his winners.

- Low-energy Jeb
- Lyin’ Ted
- Crooked Hillary
- Pocahontas
- Goofy Elizabeth Warren
- Cryin’ Chuck Schumer (came later)
- Compare Trump’s success with the underwhelming branding efforts that came from the Clinton side:

- Donald Duck
- Dangerous Donald
- Drumpf

You don’t have to be a trained persuader to see the difference in quality. But you probably don’t recognize all the technique in Trump’s nicknames. If you thought the names were nothing more than common insults, you missed a lot of his persuasion engineering. I’ll walk you through it in this chapter.

How powerful were Trump’s nicknames? So powerful that the day I heard Trump say “Low-energy Jeb” I predicted Bush was done, and blogged that opinion on August 27, 2015. Keep in mind that literally no other pundits saw this nickname as important to the election when they first heard it. But I could see its power because my brain has a filter to spot persuasion. In time, I saw a pattern emerge in Trump’s naming choices:

::: tip Trump used words that were uncommon in political campaigns, to violate our expectations and make his branding memorable. Examples: “low-energy,” “crooked,” and “lyin’.”

Trump’s nicknames were visually compatible with the person he was branding. For example, Jeb Bush did appear to have low energy (after Trump biased us by telling us to look for it).

Trump’s nicknames anticipated future confirmation bias to make them stickier and more powerful over time. We all knew “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz would say things in the future that the fact-checkers would flag, because all politicians do. In time, even his accurate and honest statements would start to look suspicious, thanks to confirmation bias and Trump’s sticky nickname.

Trump’s nicknames were designed for strategic contrast. Many voters didn’t trust Trump’s honesty and motives, so he labeled his main primary opponent Lyin’ Ted and his general election competitor Crooked Hillary. That reduced the contrast between his credibility and that of his competition.

Trump’s nicknames were a form of the High-Ground Maneuver, in which you leave the details in the weeds and focus on bigger concepts where we all agree. You might have liked Hillary Clinton’s proposed policies, but would you risk putting a “crooked” person in the Oval Office?
:::

Let’s look at how Trump’s nicknames follow the formula.

### LYIN’ TED

Trump cleverly chose nicknames that were not the type of words you normally see in politics. The normal insults that politicians traditionally sling at one another are too overused and boring to be sticky. For example, labeling an opponent a “liberal” would just make you yawn.

Politicians often accuse one another of lying. But they are usually talking about a specific situation. It is far more unusual, and far more provocative, to label the person a liar. It would be considered undiplomatic behavior. And that minor bit of wrongness helps the method work. It is just slightly more provocative than you expect from a politician. That draws your attention and makes you remember it.

But Trump apparently wanted to squeeze some extra juice from the word “lying” and make his branding stand out. So he insisted that Lyin’ Ted was the proper spelling, not Lying Ted. This was good branding. It was different from anything you have seen in politics and it gave you a reason to pause and wonder why it mattered if the spelling was “lyin’” or “lying.” It did matter, but only because you stopped and wondered about it. That is an engineered mental pause for persuasion. Trump wants you to stop and think about his choice of “lyin’” over “lying.” The fact that you spent time thinking about it helps you remember the name. It also uses a trick called “making you think past the sale.” In this case the sale is the idea that Ted Cruz lies. You end up accidentally accepting that idea because you spent time thinking about the best way to write “lyin’.” That’s strong persuasion engineering.

The Lyin’ Ted label had another big persuasion element that most people missed. You would have to be a trained persuader to even notice. Trump engineers his nicknames for future confirmation bias. By that I mean he primed our brains to see the future through his filter. Anytime Ted Cruz said anything we deemed untrue, we immediately thought of the nickname and it reinforced the association. And our minds irrationally assign importance to whatever we think about the most.

What were the odds that Cruz would say things during the campaign that you thought were untrue? 100 percent. He was a politician in a political race. They all say untrue things, or so we think. It was a perfect future trap. Lyin’ Ted was destined to do more lyin’ just by existing and being a candidate. Confirmation bias would help us see more lyin’ than was actually there.

And there’s the visual element: Ted Cruz has an unfortunate beady-eyed-liar look. If you were a movie director, you would cast him as the bad guy. He just doesn’t look honest.

Here I pause to say I know nothing of Ted Cruz’s record of honesty. I have no idea whether he is better or worse than any other politician. I’m focusing on his physical appearance and Trump’s persuasion. And on those levels, Lyin’ Ted simply looked like a liar. The reality might be very different, but that doesn’t matter to our story today. What matters is that the Lyin’ Ted nickname stuck like glue. It was fresh political wording, it was provocative, it had a visual element in Cruz’s liar-looking face, and it was designed to get stronger over time with confirmation bias.

You can’t engineer persuasion better than that.

### LIL’ MARCO
During the Republican primary season Trump nicknamed Senator Marco Rubio “Lil’ Marco.” This too was superb persuasion engineering. Almost nothing in life that is good is also “little.” It’s a negative word all by itself, and it can apply to anything from Rubio’s personality to his potential to his plans for the country to his physical height. Rubio isn’t short by normal standards, but he is shorter than Trump, and that’s all that mattered. Anytime you saw them standing together you were reminded of the nickname.

Once again we see the persuader’s engineering.

“Little” is not a typical insult in politics. It is fresh. But Trump freshens it further by making it “Lil’.”

Rubio’s physical appearance matched the label. He is somewhat baby faced and young for a politician.

The nickname created a confirmation bias: Every time you saw Rubio stand next to a taller human it made you think of his smallness. Historically, the taller candidate usually wins the presidency. Humans are biased to interpret physical size as a leadership quality. That instinct is probably left over from cave-dwelling days.

And we see “little” as a negative word on its own.

### CROOKED HILLARY
Now that you know the formula, let’s speed through the Crooked Hillary nickname.

“Crooked” is a fresh word for a political insult. Check!

Clinton’s health was a campaign question (thanks to me, in part). She needed help getting up and down stairs, and she once collapsed getting into her car. It was easy to imagine her posture as “crooked,” and that gives you the visual persuasion. Check!

Again there was a confirmation bias: Trump knew that there would be lots of opportunities to remind voters that Clinton was up to something “crooked.” The Clinton Foundation and her hacked e-mail server provided plenty of fodder. Once Trump primed you to see Clinton as crooked, it was easy to see everything she did as fitting that description, even when it didn’t. That’s how confirmation bias works. Check!

And as I already mentioned, the “crooked” label is a High-Ground Maneuver compared to the details of her policy ideas. Voters can disagree on policy, but we all agree that a crooked president is a bad idea. Check!

### POCAHONTAS AND GOOFY ELIZABETH WARREN
One of Trump’s leading critics on the left was Senator Elizabeth Warren. You have to know some backstory on Warren to know why Trump picked “Pocahontas” as one of her nicknames. Warren had at one time in the past claimed to have Native American blood. It turns out she can’t substantiate that claim. Apparently her family believed they had Native American ancestors, so it wasn’t a lie. She was just wrong. And her wrongness on that question became the most famous story about her. Trump made it more famous by calling her Pocahontas whenever she criticized him publicly.

In this case, there was no opportunity for engineering any future confirmation bias into the nickname because it was a story from the past. It was yesterday’s news. But the public didn’t know much else about Warren, so Trump didn’t have much fodder to work with.

Trump chose “Pocahontas” for several reasons that I think you can start to recognize by now. It was visual, in the sense that you imagine her in full Native American garb when you hear it. It makes you stop and think. And if you don’t understand the reference, it might make you search online to find out what it means. That’s good too, because it makes you remember it. “Pocahontas” is—once again—a fresh insult for politics. And it reminded voters that Warren had some alleged truth problems in the past.

But best of all, it was silly. And it was easy to meme. The Internet loved it. The silliness of it detracted from Warren’s credibility and gravitas. We heard her talking, but in our minds she was doing a Native American war dance in face paint and feathered headgear. It was harder to take her seriously after the nickname did its damage. Trump also referred to Warren as “goofy,” which works along the same lines to minimize her credibility.

And while you can disagree with the details of Warren’s criticisms of Trump, we all agree that goofy people are not our role models. And we don’t need to take them seriously.

### CLINTON’S NICKNAME FAILURES
If you still think Trump didn’t use deep persuasion engineering in his nicknames, compare them with Clinton’s attempts, including those from her supporters. They are completely empty of persuasion. Or worse.

First we saw the Internet trying to turn Trump’s Americanized name back to its Austrian root: Drumpf. The name is unusual, which is good persuasion, but I can’t see anything else it has going for it. Still, the word became viral because it sounded vaguely insulting. But it wasn’t persuasive.

Trump’s critics literally avoided saying his name early in the process because they didn’t want to show respect or give attention to such a monster. And perhaps they didn’t want to use Trump’s name because “trump” is synonymous with victory. But assigning a foreign-sounding name to Trump, and implying that the name was an insult, was incompatible with Clinton’s pro-immigration platform. And the mainstream media never picked up on the Drumpf nickname because Clinton herself didn’t use it. By election day, the name had mostly disappeared from social media.

A hidden-camera video by Project Veritas revealed that some of Clinton’s operatives were pushing the idea of calling Trump “Donald Duck.” The idea was to reinforce the idea that Trump was “ducking” (avoiding) showing his tax returns and whatever else he might want to avoid in the future. Knowing that politicians like to avoid unfavorable topics, this nickname had the potential for future confirmation bias. That part was good. The problem here is that Donald Duck is a cute and beloved character associated with a respected brand. And the Clinton persuasion messaging was focusing on Trump being a scary Hitler-in-waiting. Comparing him to a lovable duck is literally the opposite of what they needed. The nickname never went public. Someone was smart enough to stop it.

On top of the nickname’s persuasion problems, “Donald Duck” is owned by ABC/Disney. There was no way their lawyers would let Clinton’s team associate the character with Trump, who was by then being compared to Hitler. Every part of that nickname plan was bad.

Some Clinton supporters floated the idea of giving Trump the nickname “Dangerous Donald.”1 The name had some advantages. It fit the Clinton campaign’s main persuasion theme that said Trump was too dangerous to have his finger on the nuclear button. It was a good future-confirmation-bias trap, as Trump was likely to do or say dangerous-sounding things. And “dangerous” is a fresh word in politics. That’s all good.

The problem is that Trump supporters wanted a dangerous candidate. It wasn’t going to change their minds about anything. And dangerous might be just the thing you needed to “drain the swamp” in Washington DC, as Trump famously said, defeat ISIS, and secure the borders. “Dangerous” was too easy to flip to a positive.

Notice that Trump’s nicknames have no flipping potential. There is no political context in which being low energy, little, lying, or crooked is a good thing. But you can think of plenty of times that a dangerous person has been the right fit for a dangerous job. The military comes to mind. And Harry Truman was dangerous, dropping two nuclear bombs on Japan. Even President Obama was dangerous when he took out Bin Laden in Pakistan.

By election day, Trump still had no sticky nicknames from the Left. They tried, but their technique was lacking.

## HOW TO USE VISUAL PERSUASION

> PERSUASION TIP 18
> Visual persuasion is more powerful than nonvisual persuasion, all else being equal. And the difference is large.

Humans are visual creatures. We believe our eyes before we believe whatever faulty opinions are coming from our other senses. So if you want to persuade, use visual language and visual imagery. The difference in effectiveness is enormous.

People often asked me during the election if I was being too generous about Trump’s persuasion talents. The more popular opinion of Trump at the time, and perhaps when you read this book as well, was that his so-called persuasion was little more than lying about everything that mattered. It doesn’t take much talent to lie. But people who are not trained in persuasion would miss the technique. And most of all, they would miss the consistency of it. It would be one thing if Trump used some persuasion tricks now and then. It is a different matter when you see persuasion applied consistently and with the strongest known tools. That can be interpreted as accidental only for so long. When you see the consistency of Trump’s visual persuasion—one of his many techniques—it is hard to write it off as coincidence. You’ll need some examples, so here they are.

### THE WALL
> PERSUASION TIP 19
> In the context of persuasion, you don’t need a physical picture if you can make someone imagine the scene.

Trump could have simply said he wanted better immigration control, but that would not have been good visual persuasion. Concepts without images are weak sauce. So instead, Trump sold us a mental image of a “big, beautiful wall.” He said “wall” so many times that we all started to picture it. Before long, we started seeing artists’ renderings of potential walls. Even the opposition media started running videos of existing walls and walls in other countries.

The reason the wall imagery was good persuasion is that it was both simple to understand and memorable, compared with a generic concept such as “border control.” And it made us “think past the sale.” In other words, we reflexively assumed the wall would exist because we had imagined it so often and debated its cost. That’s one of a persuader’s most basic and well-known tricks: People automatically gravitate toward the future they are imagining most vividly, even if they don’t want the future they are seeing. You’ve probably experienced something similar in your own life. When you vividly imagine something you don’t want to happen, such as dropping your phone in the toilet, it can (for some people) increase the odds it will happen. Humans are visual creatures. Like moths, we are drawn to the brightest light. And the brightest light in our minds is whatever we can visualize most clearly. This sort of persuasion doesn’t work on every person in every situation. It isn’t that powerful. But in the context of a yearlong presidential campaign, in which you only need to persuade perhaps 5 percent of the public in order to win, every advantage counts. Trump took every persuasion advantage available, especially the ones that were free. His opponents did not.

While Trump was talking about the wall, Senator Rand Paul—one of Trump’s Republican primary challengers—had a number of smart ideas that got no traction whatsoever. Paul presented his ideas as concepts without visuals. They died on arrival.

Trump was also smart enough to be vague about the details of the wall so that each of us could imagine the wall we wanted to imagine. He could have easily provided his own artists’ renderings of the wall, but that would have been a mistake. It would have given critics lots of targets to attack. But there is one kind of wall that is hard to criticize: the one that is entirely different in each person’s head.

In my imagination, I started seeing small segments of the wall as attractive tourist destinations and special trade zones, with lots of potential for mutual benefit on both sides. Others probably imagined a harsh wall that said, “Stay out!” because that’s what they wanted or expected to see.

Trump’s critics often mentioned the impracticality of building a solid wall along the entire border. They said it would be cost prohibitive. And walls work well only in certain types of terrain. Trump acknowledged that reality a few times, but he generally stuck with his oversimplification of “the wall” because it is easy to visualize, easy to chant, and easy to remember. Compare . . .

Bad persuasion: We will use a variety of means to improve border security.

Good persuasion: We will build a big, beautiful wall.

The bad persuasion with no visuals is the more honest and accurate of the two. The good-persuasion example simplifies to the point of being inaccurate. Only one of those approaches moves the ball forward, and it isn’t the one that is accurate. Trump chose the less accurate approach with a bias for action. You will see that same bias in much of what he does, and almost always at the expense of the details that won’t make much difference to us in the long run.

When persuasion is simplified to the point of being inaccurate, do the ends justify the means? It depends what you think about the alternatives.

### ISIS AND THOSE CAGES
When Trump talked about ISIS, he always did it with scary visual imagery. He said ISIS “chops off heads” and “drowns people in cages.” You can’t get any scarier, or more visual, than that. And that persuasion gave him space to be the biggest badass on the topic, to the point of frightening half of America in the process. That positioning served him well for getting elected. If you were a voter who feared terror attacks, Trump made a persuasive case for being the toughest commander in chief. Visual imagery was vital for that framing.

### ISIS IN THE VATICAN
Here’s a brilliant example of visual persuasion, as I described it in my blog.

Posted August 20, 2015

When CNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked Trump to react to the Pope’s criticism of capitalism, Trump correctly saw it as a trap. The way the question was posed, he could either agree with the Pope, thereby criticizing capitalism, which would have been weird, or he could say the Pope was wrong, which would be risky. Both moves would be losers.

Trump couldn’t bluntly refuse to engage in the question because that would look weak. So how does Trump wiggle out of such a well-crafted media trap?

Trump responds that he would tell the Pope that ISIS is coming to get him, and that they have plans to take over the Vatican, which I assume is true, or true enough.

Do you even remember the question anymore?

Now compare the wattage coming from these two thoughts:

1. A boring discussion about corruption in capitalism (Cuomo’s question)

2. A mental picture of ISIS taking over the Vatican

No comparison. Corruption and capitalism are mere concepts that have no visual appeal. The ideas are important yet inert. But an ISIS overthrow of the Vatican is so visual that you wonder why it isn’t already a movie. And that visual is all anyone will remember of that interview in a week.

### ROSIE O’DONNELL
I mentioned earlier in the book that Trump referred to Rosie O’Donnell in the first Republican debate as his strategy to dodge a question about his past comments about women. That was visual persuasion because we immediately see her in our minds. I include it again here for completeness, so you can see how consistent Trump is with visual persuasion.

### BEN CARSON’S BELT BUCKLE
During the Republican primaries, Dr. Ben Carson briefly challenged Trump for the lead in the polls. Trump took him out of the contest by using visual persuasion. You might remember Trump acting out the alleged belt-buckle stabbing that Carson mentioned in his book. Trump stepped away from the podium at his campaign rally and mimed the attack while mocking it at the same time. Every media outlet carried his acting job. It was deeply visual and disturbing. Carson’s numbers dropped at about the same time, and never recovered. I publicly predicted Carson’s demise the day I saw Trump’s performance about the belt buckle.

### TRUMP PROPERTIES
Trump had a natural visual advantage for his accomplishments in the form of Trump properties (hotels, golf courses, etc.) around the world. Every time you saw one of those hotels you were reminded of his success. Compare that with the Clinton Foundation’s accomplishments, which had no visual element.

### AMERICA THE VISUAL
Trump always paid attention to the colors and symbols associated with his brand as a candidate. Consider . . .

You never saw him dress casually during the campaign. To do so would have removed some gravitas.

His shirt was always white, and his tie colors were always in the color palette of the American flag. None of this is coincidence.

As I’ll describe in more detail in the next chapter, Trump agreed to appear on Saturday Night Live on a set designed to look like the Oval Office, flags and all. The candidates appearing on SNL would have had veto rights over any skit concepts. That means he agreed to appear in the one with the best imagery. That isn’t an accident.

Trump’s private jet reminds you of Air Force One. Your brain can’t help but make that connection. If social media is our guide, a lot of people noticed the similarity in aircraft. Trump owned the jet long before he became a candidate for president, but you can bet he planned his flight schedule for maximum impact. The media fed us images of Clinton exiting her high-end jet that didn’t look at all like Air Force One, while we saw Trump walking down the runway from his Boeing 757 looking as if he were already president.

When you think of Hillary Clinton, how many iconic symbols of America spring to mind? For most of you, the answer will be none.

## HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE IMAGINE YOU AS PRESIDENT

From the day that Trump announced his candidacy, his biggest persuasion challenge was that people literally couldn’t imagine him as president. We can easily imagine boring old senators and governors becoming presidents. But it was tough to imagine this orange ball of provocation sitting in the Oval Office. And so I watched in awe as Trump methodically fixed his biggest problem by helping us imagine his presidency until we could do it on our own. His best persuasion move on this front involved his appearance on the late-night television show Saturday Night Live.

I have enough experience appearing on TV and radio—having done it several hundred times—that I know some things that the general public wouldn’t necessarily know. One thing I know is that a guest as important as a presidential candidate gets a hard veto over any skit they are in. And that means Trump approved the SNL skit that imagined him as president and working in the Oval Office. I have a distinct memory of Trump in the Oval Office on SNL, but I can’t remember a single joke from the skit. Visual memory overwhelms any other kind of memory, and vision is the most persuasive of your senses.

I assume the jokes on SNL that night were at Trump’s expense. I assume the humor was edgy but not so bad that Trump would veto any of it. SNL allowed Trump to show his sense of humor, which is one of his strengths. But more important, it created a future “visual memory” of Trump in the Oval Office. If you saw that episode live, or on social media later, you suddenly had an easy way to imagine Trump as president. SNL did that for him.

Compare Trump’s skit with Hillary Clinton’s appearance on Saturday Night Live. She approved a skit in which she played a bartender named Val who was serving a drunken Hillary Clinton who was played by one of the SNL cast. The visual we got from that was that Clinton loves alcohol—maybe too much. That is just about the worst image you could present for a presidential candidate. And it is doubly bad because of the power of contrast. Trump was a rare nondrinking candidate for president. He was competing for a job that required sobriety at all hours of the day. And thanks to SNL, he was competing against the image of a drunk.

After seeing how both candidates handled their SNL choices, my opinion of Trump’s chances was set in concrete. Barring any surprises (and there were plenty to come), this was not going to be a fair fight. To me it looked like a massacre in the making.

In political terms, and looking back at the SNL skit, if you are helping people think of you as the president of the United States while your competitor is self-branding as a barfly, you are right where you want to be.

Here are a few comics on the power of contrast.

Within a few days of President Trump’s inauguration, he had signed a flurry of executive orders, stirred up several controversies, and created more news per hour than anyone had imagined possible. I blogged at the time that it was brilliant persuasion. I wrote a post on it and titled it “Dilution Outrage.”

Posted January 26, 2017

I’m having a fun time watching President Trump flood the news cycle with so many stories and outrages that no one can keep up. Here’s how the math of persuasion works in this situation:

1 outrage out of 3 headlines in a week: bad persuasion

25 outrages out of 25 headlines in a week: excellent persuasion

At the moment, there are so many outrages, executive orders, protests, and controversies that none of them can get enough oxygen in our brains. I can’t obsess about problem X because the rest of the alphabet is coming at me at the same time.

When you encounter a situation that is working great except for one identifiable problem, you can focus on the problem and try to fix it. But if you have a dozen complaints at the same time, none of them looks special. The whole situation just looks confusing, and you don’t know where to start. So you wait and see what happens. Humans need contrast in order to make solid decisions that turn into action. Trump removed all of your contrast by providing multiple outrages of similar energy.

You’re probably seeing the best persuasion you will ever see from a new president. Instead of dribbling out one headline at a time, so the vultures and critics can focus their fire, Trump has flooded the playing field. You don’t know where to aim your outrage. He’s creating so many opportunities for disagreement that it’s mentally exhausting. Literally. He’s wearing down the critics, replacing their specific complaints with entire encyclopedias of complaints. And when Trump has created a hundred reasons to complain, do you know what impression will be left with the public?

He sure got a lot done.

Even if you don’t like it.

In only a few days, Trump has made us question what the hell every other president was doing during their first weeks in office. Were they even trying?

Update: Trump’s strong start got bogged down by Congress, and the courts, soon after I wrote this section. His most notable early “failure” was the first version of an Obamacare replacement. And you know why it failed?

Because the contrast with Obamacare wasn’t good.

Every decision is a comparison of alternatives. If you control how people see the alternatives, you can sell anything. Trump did a great job of eroding the credibility of Obamacare, but the first GOP plan for its replacement failed on the contrast level because experts said fewer people would be covered.

The best persuasion play for health care would be to create a bill that covers more people, one way or another. That is a winning contrast. Covering fewer people is a losing contrast. The other details of the bill hardly matter when you have that problem.

I am writing this before the next health-care bill is crafted. My prediction is that if the new one covers fewer people, it will likely fail. If it covers more people, it will probably pass.

You can use the power of contrast to improve every part of your professional and personal life. Here are some suggestions to get you started.

Participate in activities at which you excel compared with others. People’s impression of you as talented and capable compared with the average participant will spill over to the rest of your personal brand.

In business, always present your ideas in the context of alternatives that are clearly worse. Don’t just sell your proposed solution; slime all the other options with badness.

If someone you know is treating a small issue as a big one, remind them what a big problem looks like. That can reframe how they process their small worries.

Always remember that people make decisions in the context of alternatives. If you aren’t framing the alternatives as bad, you are not persuading at all.

## HOW I GOT THE VP PREDICTION WRONG
Here’s a story that highlights the power of contrast. Notice how often I circle back to this theme. Contrast is essential to persuasion.

My critics like to point out that I made a few wrong predictions about Trump’s pick for his VP running mate. In those failings you can see the limits of persuasion as a predictor. The VP decision involved lots of variables that are invisible to the public. We don’t know how the candidates get along personally. We don’t know what kind of scandals the background checks turned up. We don’t know how interested any particular candidate would be in taking the job. Persuasion is not a predictive variable in those cases. But in the spirit of evaluating the Persuasion Filter, I confess that I publicly suggested in February of 2016 that Mark Cuban would be a powerful VP pick for Trump to make the ticket seem less scary to Democrats. I stopped short of predicting that Trump would choose Cuban, but it was close enough to a prediction that I’ll acknowledge I missed it anyway. As it turned out, Cuban became one of Trump’s leading critics. That’s as big a miss as you can get. I will, however, take credit for writing in that same blog post that Cuban would be a good pick because he would be willing to turn on Trump the minute it looked like the right thing to do. And turn he did, when he thought it was the right thing to do (I assume), endorsing Clinton and becoming one of the loudest of the Trump critics.

Later, in February of 2016, I predicted that Chris Christie would be a good pick for the VP job. Christie got along with Trump, was early to endorse him, and is a fighter, like Trump. But I didn’t stick with that prediction.

By May 2016, I had updated my VP prediction to say ex-Senator Scott Brown would be the best fit. He was an experienced politician, and handsome—which matters even if you think it shouldn’t. As written, I wasn’t exactly making a prediction, but I’ll call it a prediction anyway to make my bigger point when I get to it.

Now compare my accurate predictions throughout the campaign with my misses on the VP selection. The pattern tells you a lot about the dynamics of persuasion. It is hard to predict what one person will do with one decision at one specific time. But it is relatively easy to predict that a Master Persuader with twenty-four-hour news coverage and a massive social media following, operating for over a year, could sway enough voters to win in a country that is normally about evenly split.

Time is always on the side of the persuader. If you give me enough time, and I repeat the same message often enough, I can sway 5 percent of any crowd to believe anything. And 5 percent is usually enough to win the presidency in the United States because most elections are close affairs due to party loyalties.

I had never heard of Mike Pence before Trump selected him as his VP running mate. But as soon as I saw Pence, and heard him speak, I knew he was a strong pick from a persuasion perspective. And that’s because of the power of contrast.

On a strategic and political level, Pence was a smart pick because he consolidated the Republican conservative base. And Trump had said he wanted a seasoned politician, which the public and pundits agreed was a good idea. Pence had experience as both a governor and a senator, which is about as good as you can get. So on all the dimensions that people normally value for a VP pick, Pence checked the boxes. He even won his only debate against Clinton’s VP running mate, Tim Kaine.

But that isn’t the whole story. The real story is about the power of contrast.

The last thing a presidential candidate wants is for pundits and voters to start wondering why the number two person isn’t the number one person. You need a VP running mate whom the country takes seriously, but one who also has far less charisma than the top of the ticket. Pence created a perfect contrast to Trump. Not only did he add the seriousness that voters wanted, but when he stood next to Trump, he literally looked like the washed-out version. Pence is like a black-and-white photograph compared with Trump’s multimedia looks and personality. Pence is one of the most experienced and capable politicians our country has ever produced, but he still disappears in Trump’s charisma field. That’s perfect persuasion because voters respond to contrast more than they do to facts and reason.

The best example of the contrast principle was Ronald Reagan picking George H. W. Bush as his running mate. Bush was a deeply experienced politician, but boring compared with Reagan’s star power. Reagan went on to become such a popular president that Bush was the automatic front-runner for the job after Reagan served two terms. But Bush had a contrast problem of his own. He needed to pick a running mate who looked substantial enough to be taken seriously while still creating a favorable contrast for Bush. That didn’t give him much room to operate.

Bush was boring compared with Reagan, but now Bush needed his own running mate who could make Bush-the-boring look like a natural leader by contrast. Enter Dan Quayle. He was weaker than Bush, who was weaker than Reagan. That’s a lot of dilution. And it is no surprise that Quayle did not go on to the presidency. He didn’t even stay on the ticket when Bush ran for reelection. Quayle was two levels of charisma away from Reagan.

> PERSUASION TIP 20
> People are more persuaded by contrast than by facts or reason. Choose your contrasts wisely.

Mike Pence might someday have the same contrast problem. If Trump has a successful presidency, Pence has a good chance of being the next Republican candidate for president. That means Pence would need to choose for his running mate a more boring version of himself. And that future VP candidate would be two levels of charisma away from Trump. That’s too much of a gap.

Had I known Mike Pence was a potential VP pick, I think I would have ranked him in the top three options without knowing much about him except his looks, his job experience, and his Republican credentials.

## HOW TO PERSUADE BY ASSOCIATION

One of the easiest forms of persuasion involves associating one image or idea with another in a way that makes some of the goodness (or badness) of one rub off on the other. That’s the idea behind celebrity endorsements, labeling political opponents Nazis, and marketing in general. But you already knew that.

What you might not know is that each of us is “marketing” all the time. If you want to be liked and respected, you have to watch your accidental associations. For example, I know people who think bathroom humor is hilarious. I’m not here to judge their sense of humor, as that is subjective. The problem is that these folks think that sharing this sort of humor is nothing more than a laugh. But it is a lot more. It is persuasion by association. And if you tell enough bathroom jokes, your friends and family will literally start subconsciously associating you with shit. They might not be aware of the accidental persuasion. The way it manifests is that suddenly your friends feel too busy to get together with you.

The same concept holds for folks who talk endlessly about their own health problems. I care about people, and I want to know the gist of their situations. But if they dwell on it, and include visual descriptions and lots of details about their suffering, I start to see the person and the health problem as one and the same.

No one wants that.

When I was younger, I made all of the mistakes of association that I’m mentioning, and more. I figured that if something was funny, or appalling, it needed to be shared, all in the spirit of fun. My more experienced self tries to stick to topics that are interesting, useful, and positive. I still like jokes, obviously, but not the gross kind that lack cleverness.

As a general rule, I try to fill my brain with optimistic thoughts in order to crowd out the bad ones that sometimes slip in. This is a form of self-hypnosis, using the power of association. The positive thoughts lift my energy, which in turn lifts my mood, and even my immune system.

If you are trying to get past a negative thought or memory, try distracting yourself with positive images and ideas. Or change your scenery to something that has a positive vibe. You can program yourself all the way from a funk to a good mood if you change the inputs. And best of all, you can do the same to others. Fill their heads with positive thoughts and they will associate those good feelings with you. They couldn’t separate those feelings if they tried.

If you want to make a good first impression, don’t jokingly complain about the traffic on the way over. Try to work into the initial conversation some positive thoughts and images. Any positivity works. If your positivity has some visual imagery, that is even better. As the old saying goes, people won’t always remember what you said, but they almost always remember how you made them feel.

You’ve probably heard it said that walking a dog is a great way to meet people. That’s partly because dogs have such a powerful association with happiness, at least for dog lovers. If you love dogs, it is hard to be unhappy when you meet a new one. All of the good feelings you have had from every past dog transfer automatically to the new dog and its owner.

Another easy way to influence yourself by association is to decorate your living space in a way that you find emotionally pleasing. You can train yourself to enjoy a room so much that you become happy just by walking into it. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that because your favorite color is gunmetal gray, it makes a good wall color. Ideally, you want wall colors that give you the right kind of energy for whatever you do in that room. Gray isn’t usually the right answer.

> PERSUASION TIP 21
> When you associate any two ideas or images, people’s emotional reaction to them will start to merge over time.

As I’ll describe in the next chapter, Trump got the advantage of persuasion by association when he crafted his campaign slogan to match Ronald Reagan’s. The persuasion works even if all it does is make the haters argue that you are not like Reagan at all. What matters is the mental association, not the details. And associating your name with Reagan is a good way to win the Republican nomination.

## HOW TO CREATE EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN SLOGANS AND LOGOS

If you are just becoming acquainted with the concepts of cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias because of this book, you probably have no reliable way of sorting out Trump’s “natural” persuasion instincts from his acquired knowledge. But I think the story becomes more clear when you look at Trump’s campaign slogans and visual imagery compared with the losing effort on the Clinton side. I think all observers would agree that Trump won the branding battle. Bigly. Let’s take a look at the technique he used to do it.

Trump’s famous campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” was borrowed from Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign, although Trump says he wasn’t aware of it when he decided to use it.

And what happened when the media figured out that Trump was borrowing from Reagan? They wrote about it. They talked about it. They tried to turn it into a criticism about unoriginality without saying that directly. And when they were done with all that chatter, you remembered one thing: Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump have a similar vision.

That is a huge persuasion win, and it might have been an accident. Trump’s biggest problem at the start was that he wasn’t a career politician, and it was hard for the public to see him as one. The best persuasion solution in that situation is to graft your reputation to an outsider who not only became president but also became a legend in the job. Although Reagan had political experience as governor of California before becoming president, the public still has a reflex to think of him as an actor who became president, because that’s the more interesting story. Reagan’s success was the perfect pattern to put in people’s heads. The pattern reminded us that an outsider can become one of the most beloved presidents in American history. Trump got all of that benefit by association from the start, and it never faded. That association alone would have made Trump’s choice of slogans one of the best branding decisions of our lifetime, although as I said, it might have been an accident. But it goes deeper.

Now let’s look at the words in “Make America Great Again.” This is deep engineering. You won’t see it clearly until we talk about Clinton’s competing slogans and how bad they were. Your first impression in this chapter might be that I’m trying too hard to force a smart interpretation on Trump’s choice of slogans. But wait until you see the full picture. For trained persuaders such as me, this is amazing.

Every word in “Make America Great Again” is active and powerful. Check it out:

Make: A power/dominance word that speaks of creation and manufacturing (i.e., jobs).

America: The strongest brand in every American voter’s mind. It speaks to our identity and it fit comfortably with Trump’s nationalist (America first) proposition.

Great: The word speaks to power/dominance and success.

Again: This word caused critics to debate whether America was already great or not. That’s a nonsense debate because there is no agreed standard by which national greatness can be measured. But that doesn’t matter for persuasion. What mattered is that the country was talking about Trump’s slogan: Was it a mistake for Trump to include the word “again”? Did Reagan use that same word? Is the country really so bad now?

When you consider the Reagan association, the perfect fit with Trump’s nationalist message, and the power in each word, you start to see the deep persuasion that is engineered into the slogan.

But Trump wasn’t done yet.

He put the phrase on a red hat. Red is the boss of all colors. It is also the color associated with Republicans, which was convenient. But trust me when I say that if the Republican color had been a shade of baby blue, Trump would not have used that color in his brand. Any businessperson who understands branding knows the power of color. Red means action, dominance, and sex.1 It was the perfect color for the Trump campaign. Compare that with the pink hats that became popular with Clinton supporters. Pink is the most wrong choice you can make if you are trying to persuade American men to join your team. Many women reject the color too. You can’t do a worse job of color picking than that.

Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan also did a perfect job of framing the situation as one in which individual citizens and their leaders focus on the betterment of America. You might think it is obvious that any campaign slogan should have that message. But compare that with one of Clinton’s several failed campaign slogans: “I’m with her.” That slogan doesn’t speak to the betterment of the country. It literally suggests that citizens should be doing something for one person—Hillary Clinton. A campaign slogan can’t fail much harder than that.

The slogan “Make America Great Again” was also catchy as all get-out. It even has what I call in authors’ lingo a percussion rhythm to it. A great sentence sounds good—in a way that music sounds good—independent of the meaning. The letters M, K, G, and T are powerful, like a drumbeat. Compare the powerful beat of Make America Great Again with the weak-sounding background hum of “I’m with Her.” Not even close.

Trump’s powerful slogan was born whole, and it rented a room in our brains on day one. It never left. It just got more powerful over time. But Clinton’s team struggled and never found its brand. Among her poorly engineered slogans we saw:

I’m with Her
I’m Ready for Hillary
Fighting for Us
Breaking Down Barriers
Stronger Together
The New York Times reported that the campaign cycled through eighty-five different slogan concepts before settling on “Stronger Together.”2 That sounds like committee work, and I doubt most of the participants had persuasion training. Trump allegedly came up with his slogan on his own.

Most of Clinton’s slogans failed on the most basic level because they talked about the candidate and the party more than the country. In the context of the campaign, it seemed as if the unity those slogans represented was the unity of Clinton supporters themselves, not the country as a whole. Let’s look at a few of Clinton’s slogans individually.

“I’m with Her”: This slogan emphasized Clinton’s gender, implying that it must be some kind of advantage. As a man, I found this off-putting and tone deaf. It was also off message for someone running to be president of all Americans. My opinion doesn’t represent men in general, but you only have to offend 5 percent of either gender to have a big problem. This slogan was more problem than solution.

“I’m Ready for Hillary”: This slogan is about the voter, not the candidate, and certainly not the country. Worse yet, it assumes some sort of smug superiority in being “ready” for a woman president. There are no power words in the sentence and it is not the least bit catchy—which was a blessing in disguise in this case. This one didn’t last long.

“Fighting for Us”: Who is us? If Clinton intended “us” to mean Americans, why not say so? The implication is that the “us” is Clinton’s supporters. Or maybe it refers to anyone who faces discrimination, such as women and minorities of all types. But whatever it was supposed to mean, it didn’t sound like it was talking about America as a whole. For example, would a white male voter—a member of the patriarchy, in some people’s opinion—think the slogan meant that Clinton would be fighting for him or against him?

“Breaking Down Barriers”: This slogan suggests that Clinton’s focus would be on fighting for the disadvantaged. But no matter how worthy that goal might be, in order to win the election, she had to get the support of voters who see the world in terms of winners and losers. Would those people breaking down barriers be taking jobs from the people on the other side? This slogan doesn’t make anyone think of a win-win situation. It does have a good percussion to it. But that’s all it has.

“Stronger Together”: This slogan was the best of the bunch, and it got the most attention during the campaign. But while it seemed on the surface to be a harmless slogan about strength in numbers, things started to turn when Clinton’s supporters became bullies, both online and in real life. Suddenly the “stronger together” theme started to sound like a pack of bullies attacking people who disagreed. Those bullies were indeed stronger together.

Yes, I know Trump supporters did bad things too. But their behavior didn’t have a campaign slogan that made it sound more ominous than it already was. The “Stronger Together” slogan started to feel—at least to my ears—like an angry mob of bullies who didn’t like the other half of the country.

### THE MOLE
Hillary Clinton’s persuasion game was so weak and backward on Twitter that I came up with the fun idea that her Twitter assistant must be a mole (a traitor) from the Trump campaign. The wrongness of Clinton’s persuasion attempts on Twitter was so consistent that even today I wonder if it was intentional sabotage. My Twitter followers and I enjoyed spotting the alleged work of the Mole and tweeting about it. It was more fun than serious.

I was blogging and tweeting about “the Mole” for months, offering plenty of examples. I assumed that some of my writing on the topic was reaching the right people in the Clinton campaign. After all, much of the mainstream media was reading my blog. I know that because so many of them interviewed me or contacted me privately about what I wrote. So why didn’t Clinton’s social media people fix their easy-to-fix problem? That’s still a mystery to me. Maybe the right person on Clinton’s team never saw my criticisms. Or maybe the Mole was real. I doubt I will ever know.

The biggest recurring problem with Clinton’s tweets was that she repeatedly asked voters to “Imagine President Trump” doing one thing or another that they thought would be bad. In the second dimension, that approach makes perfect sense. No one wants a president who is likely to do bad things. And making you imagine those bad things is normally a good persuasion tactic. That follows a trial lawyer approach of painting a picture and inviting the jury (in this case voters) to imagine being in the scene. Usually this is a solid persuasion technique. But it wasn’t in this special case.

Here’s why.

If you make voters imagine a President Trump, that makes it far easier for them to . . . wait for it . . . imagine a President Trump. And making voters imagine Trump as president was exactly what Trump was trying to do. This worked perfectly to help solve his biggest problem—voters couldn’t imagine him in the job.

But what about the second part of the tweet, in which we are asked to imagine Trump doing something dangerously wrong? Doesn’t that make up for the first part of the sentence?

No, it doesn’t. Not even close.

Persuaders know that humans put more importance on the first part of a sentence than the second part. Our first impressions are hard to dislodge. And the first impression of those tweets—lots of them—involved imagining Trump winning the election.

But it gets worse. In many cases, the tweets asked voters to imagine President Trump while providing only a link to the punch line. People don’t always click links, especially if they think they know what the link will say. And once Clinton created the “Imagine President Trump” pattern, you didn’t need to click the link to know it was something negative about him. So you imagined Trump as president, as asked, and moved to the next tweet in your timeline.

I’m not done yet. Clinton’s tweets also make voters “think past the sale” to a future where there is a President Trump. If you are making people wonder how Trump would perform as president, you have already sold them on the idea that he will be president. This is one of the most basic and well-known rules of persuasion.

### LOVE TRUMPS HATE
One of the more notable persuasion failures from the Clinton campaign involved the slogan Love Trumps Hate. The first two thirds of the slogan is literally “Love Trump.” Again, human brains put more weight on the first part of a sentence than the end. On a rational level, the sentence makes perfect sense, and it says what Trump’s critics wanted it to say. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, this slogan simply told the world to either love Trump or love the things he hates, such as terrorism and bad trade deals.

Google made a similar branding mistake with its initial company slogan, “Don’t Be Evil.” In the 2-D world, that slogan is playful, clear, and morally appropriate. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, Google paired its brand with evil. You can’t unsee the association. Worse yet, that sort of slogan gives the critics an easy target should there ever be a corporate misstep. And there are always corporate missteps when you are as large as Google. The company wisely dropped that slogan from its code of conduct in October of 2015.3

### MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN
Here’s another enormous persuasion problem Democrats caused for themselves in their attempt to use Trump’s campaign slogan against him on the issue of health-care reform. Once again, they made the mistake of not realizing that the first impression is the only one that counts. And our first impression is Nancy Pelosi dressed like a Pepto-Bismol bottle standing next to a sign that suggests we should make America sick. Yes, the details of the sign clarify its intent to mean something else. But from a branding and persuasion perspective, this was an epic fail. So much so that many of my Twitter followers spontaneously suggested that the Mole had gotten a new assignment that involved making signs.

## GODZILLA GETS IN THE GAME (OR DOES HE?)

One of the interesting side stories of the election involved a major player in the election campaign whom I nicknamed Godzilla. I used a nickname because I wasn’t yet sure the monster of persuasion whom I had in mind had really entered the fight. I thought I could see his paw print on Clinton’s message by the summer of 2016, but I needed more evidence before outing Godzilla in public.

And by “Godzilla” I mean the Godzilla of influence. I’m talking about the one person on the planet who could take the flamethrower out of Trump’s hand, flip it around, and turn him into an orange ember. If I was right, the election was about to become a fair fight for the first time. Without Godzilla on her side, Clinton was unarmed and helpless. Once Godzilla entered the fight, all bets were off. It was the story you didn’t see on television. Not even once. And it was the only story that mattered from that point on. Everything else was second-dimension noise.

Prior to the summer of 2016, while Senator Bernie Sanders was still competing for the Democratic nomination, the Clinton persuasion game was nonexistent. I have already described her campaign’s backward-persuasion tweeting and their artless campaign slogans. As far as I could tell, no one trained in persuasion was advising the Clinton team. I saw no signs of that talent whatsoever, and the signs would have been obvious to me. I told you earlier that it takes a persuader to spot a persuader. I saw nothing.

I can’t say the same for the Sanders campaign. Sanders was beating expectations everywhere. He even had the best (most persuasive) television campaign ad of the election. I noted it at the time in my blog, and a Vanderbilt University study later named it the most effective ad of the election, reporting that it made people happy and hopeful.1 The ad featured optimistic-looking people streaming toward a seaside stage to see Sanders speak, all to the tune of a patriotic song by Simon & Garfunkel, “America.” It was uplifting and inspirational. It was an identity play—the strongest positive form of persuasion. It was right on message. It showed real persuasion talent—the kind I was not seeing from Clinton’s side.

In the end, Sanders’s persuasion advantage was not powerful enough to stop Clinton from winning the nomination. Clinton’s fund-raising advantage and her entrenched support within the leadership of the party were too much to overcome.

Many observers were surprised how well Sanders did. Polls even said he would be the stronger candidate against Trump. That’s an impressive campaign performance from a disheveled old socialist with no charisma and a budget that didn’t add up. When you see someone exceed expectations by that much, it is often a sign of a Master Persuader. President Obama was a Master Persuader (or was advised by one), and he beat expectations. Bill Clinton was a Master Persuader (or was advised by one). He beat expectations too.

But Sanders was not a Master Persuader. He didn’t exhibit that kind of talent in unscripted interviews. And that means he probably had a Master Persuader advising him to get the main messaging right, and perhaps the campaign ads too. There were signs of real persuasion skills all over Sanders’s campaign, but none for Clinton.

That changed right after Sanders lost the nomination. But why?

If Sanders had a Master Persuader advising his team—someone such as Godzilla, for example—that adviser would have become a free agent after Clinton locked down the Democratic nomination. At about the same time, and perhaps not by coincidence, Clinton’s team went from having no persuasion game at all to weapons-grade persuasion. It was a sudden change that I noticed in real time. I could see the fingerprints of one Master Persuader in particular. I figured I was seeing either the Master Persuader of all Master Persuaders—Godzilla—or perhaps one of his many protégés. All I knew for sure is that I could see Godzilla’s DNA all over the Clinton messaging from the summer on.

Here’s how I described it in my blog.

Posted July 24, 2016

If you are following the media coverage after the GOP convention, you know that Democrats and their surrogates are describing Trump’s speech as “dark.” The first ten times I heard the word, I thought it might be a situation in which someone clever used the term once and others copied it.

That is not the case.

“Dark” is a linguistic kill shot from the Left. I assume all the TV pundits on Clinton’s team got the message to use the word “dark.” I confess that at first I didn’t recognize how good it is. It is engineered persuasion, Trump style, and it didn’t come from an amateur. The Clinton team is playing some serious 3-D chess now.

Do you remember all of those policy details Clinton talked about this week? Me neither. She’s done with that uselessness now. She went full Voldemort on Trump this week and unleashed a “dark” spell. It’s a good one.

Let me tell you why “dark” is so good.

It’s unique. That’s a Trump trick. You haven’t heard “dark” used before in a political context. That makes it memorable and sticky. And it brings no baggage with it to this domain because no other politician has been so labeled.

“Dark” makes you think of black, and black makes you think of racism (in the political season, anyway), and that makes you reflexively pair Trump with racism even though it makes no sense.

“Dark” can describe anything scary. It invites the listener to fill in the nightmare with whatever scares them the most about Trump. That’s a hypnosis trick. Leave out the details and let people fill in the story that persuades them the most.

Repetition. “Dark” is the kind of word that pundits can work into almost any answer when talking about Trump. That means you’ll hear it a lot.

I don’t think this one word will change the election by much. But it’s a sign that Clinton has at least one world-class persuader/adviser on the team. I have a feeling I know who. This linguistic kill shot has a partial fingerprint. If I’m right, Godzilla just got into the game.

By August I was putting a name to Godzilla because I had learned that he had advised President Obama in his 2012 campaign. When I first saw Godzilla’s fingerprints on the election, I had no idea he had ever worked on a presidential campaign. But according to the New York Times, he had. The New York Times reported in November 2012, after Obama’s unexpected victory:

[The] Obama campaign also had a panel of unpaid academic advisers. The group—which calls itself the “consortium of behavioral scientists,” or COBS—provided ideas on how to counter false rumors, like one that President Obama is a Muslim. It suggested how to characterize the Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in advertisements. It also delivered research-based advice on how to mobilize voters.

The article went on to say, ”The consortium included Susan T. Fiske of Princeton University; Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California, San Diego; Robert Cialdini, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University; Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago’s business school; and Michael Morris, a psychologist at Columbia.”

There it was: Robert Cialdini. Author of the book Influence, the most well-known book on the power of persuasion. His new book, Pre-Suasion, was just hitting shelves around election day. I had an advance copy of his new book, signed and mailed to me by Cialdini himself. He was aware of my blogging on the topic of persuasion, and I assume he knew that I often recommended his book. In fact, both of his books are on my Persuasion Reading List in appendix A.

Cialdini’s newer book, Pre-Suasion, focuses on how to prime a person to be persuaded. It teaches how to put a thought in a person’s mind that will influence the next thought in ways that would not be obvious to the untrained. I mentioned earlier a study in which volunteers were shown an image of an American flag before being asked which political candidate they preferred. The volunteers who saw the American flag immediately before they were asked to pick a candidate were far more likely to prefer a Republican. That’s pre-suasion: You add the influence before the question is even asked.

And that brings me back to the word “dark.”

“Dark” is pre-suasion. “Dark” primes you to see whatever Trump does next as having bad intentions. “Dark” sets your brain’s filter to see evil. “Dark” is not normal campaign talk. “Dark” is not even normal influence. “Dark” is pre-suasion.

“Dark” is a partial fingerprint.

“Dark” sounds like Cialdini’s work.

Cialdini is Godzilla.

Am I sure? No. But I mentioned my hypothesis to a feature writer, who tried to track Cialdini down for a response. According to the writer, the response was “No comment.” Which to my ears does not sound like a person who is not advising a candidate.

Also, people who know Cialdini personally told the writer who tracked this down that he was advising Clinton. I won’t call that confirmation because I heard it from someone who heard it from someone else. But the hypothesis fits.

Coincidentally—or not—I had a few direct communications with Cialdini during the election, via Twitter direct messaging. We follow each other on Twitter, and that means we can send private messages. The messages were about his new book. He asked if he could send me a prepublication copy. This is normal business for authors. You send advance copies to anyone who might say good things about the book in public. I gave him my home address to mail it. We exchanged professional compliments. That was it.

At about the same time, Cialdini knew I was publicly naming him as Godzilla. My followers on social media were tweeting my Godzilla mentions to him. Breitbart ran a big article saying I had named Cialdini as a Clinton adviser. He had my contact information. He could have easily and privately told me he wasn’t advising Clinton.

I never got a message of that type.

Godzilla was in the game.

Now it was a fair fight.

Over the summer of 2016, Clinton’s persuasion game went from laughable to weapons grade. She painted a picture of Trump that was dark to the extreme. Clinton and her surrogates tirelessly repeated the pre-suasion word “dark.” The word came to represent all of Trump’s alleged flaws. “Dark” meant racism and authoritarianism. It meant reckless behavior. It meant inappropriate language and actions. It meant he was mentally unbalanced. It meant whatever the voters wanted it to mean, so long as it was something negative.

I taught you that the second-best form of persuasion is an appeal to identity. Trump was using identity to brand his campaign as a movement for all Americans. It was strong persuasion, and it was working. The only way to top identity persuasion is with the number one best persuasion form: fear.


A big fear beats every other form of persuasion. Clinton used the word “dark” to capture all of our fears in one scary package that we couldn’t forget. We’re afraid of the dark, and when Clinton was done campaigning, half of the country was afraid of Trump as well. Not just a little bit afraid. Not simply concerned that his policies would be suboptimal. This was real fear. This was fear to the bone. And it worked. Clinton started to build a solid lead over Trump in the polls.2

I told you earlier in this book that Trump brought a flamethrower to a stick fight. But now Godzilla was taking sides with the sticks. Flamethrowers won’t stop Godzilla. Clinton’s campaign machine, combined with Godzilla’s message magic, could easily be enough to take Trump out of the game unless he performed flawlessly.

Trump did not perform flawlessly, but he had a powerful set of tools, and he had momentum. By now even some of his biggest critics, such as Michael Moore, started to openly worry that he had enough persuasion power to pull off an upset.

Even against Godzilla.


## HOW TO GET AWAY WITH BAD BEHAVIOR

My mother had a favorite saying, origin unknown: “You can get used to anything if you do it long enough. Even hanging.” She trotted out that saying whenever my siblings or I complained about something that wasn’t going to change.

> PERSUASION TIP 22
> People automatically get used to minor annoyances over time.

My mom’s point of view captures an important rule in persuasion. People can get past minor annoyances if you give them enough time. Humans quickly adapt to just about anything that doesn’t kill them.

That’s good news for people who have annoying habits. If you can’t change your habits, acknowledge them with humor and wait for people to get used to you. If your intentions are good, sometimes that’s all you need.

If your brain didn’t have the ability to ignore minor annoyances, you would have trouble functioning. Your daily experience is brimming with small annoyances. If every one of them stayed at the top of your priority list, you wouldn’t be able to get anything done. One of your brain’s best features is its ability to automatically get over your smaller problems so you can focus on your bigger ones.


You see this dynamic most vividly in your personal life. When a small misunderstanding between you and a loved one plunges you into an angry mood, the bad feeling starts to wear off in a few days even if nothing changes but the passage of time. The human mind is designed to “get over it” whenever the stakes are not high. And the stakes are not high for most of what we do.

This rule of persuasion helped me predict a Trump presidency a year before most observers could see it as a possibility. The most common objection I heard when Trump first announced his run was that people simply could not wrap their heads around the possibility that this obnoxious monster could ever be acceptable to enough voters to become president. Most people probably assumed their initial opinions of Trump would remain stable. As a trained persuader, I assumed the opposite, because people can get used to anything if they do it long enough. I could see from the start of the election that for many people Trump’s personal style was annoying to the point of painful. I also knew the public would have a full year to get used to his personality. And I knew that the longer they experienced it, the less outrageous it would seem—at least for some portion of the public. Others would harden their resistance. But the latter group was never going to vote for Trump anyway. The people who mattered were the ones who disliked his style but didn’t yet have a final opinion about his politics. That group was going to get used to Trump’s personality over time. It was inevitable. That’s how our brains are wired. For most people, novelty wears off. To be fair, some people will get more bothered by Trump’s personality over time. But as I said, people who had super hardened hate for Trump at the start were unlikely to vote for him anyway.

As I mentioned earlier in the book, one advantage I had as a Trump observer was that I grew up in New York. But I’ve lived my adult life in California, and that gives me a basis for comparison. One of the big differences between those two states is that the residents appear to have different senses of humor. Take, for example, Trump’s comment about Senator John McCain’s war record. During an interview on July 18, 2015, at the Family Leadership Summit, Trump dismissed McCain’s criticisms by joking that he prefers veterans who “weren’t captured.” A lot of people found that comment offensive. I think some people didn’t even recognize it as a joke. And even if voters did see it as a joke, many considered it deeply offensive to Senator McCain, to veterans, and even to America.

But let me teach you something about a New York sense of humor. If you don’t understand what New Yorkers think is funny, Trump looks like a monster. From a California perspective, Trump’s comments about McCain are deeply disturbing. That’s because Californians put the wrong frame on it. I’ll fix that for you right now. Here’s what you need to know about a New York sense of humor. (And obviously this is a generality that won’t apply to all.)

When we current or ex–New Yorkers laugh at “offensive” jokes, we are usually reacting to the awfulness of it. We are not laughing at the target of the joke. (Again, this is a generality.) Trump’s quip about preferring veterans who didn’t get caught is a perfect example. It’s funny because the idea is so awful. In other words, the person telling the offensive joke and the person offended by the joke are on exactly the same side. An average New Yorker thinks the inappropriateness of the joke is what makes it funny, whereas the Californian sees it as an attack on the individual—in this case, a highly respected veteran. I saw Trump’s joke as a playful response and the type of thing he might say to his best friend. Californians saw a monster acting like a monster. Same world, different movies.

> PERSUASION TIP 23
> What you say is important, but it is never as important as what people think you are thinking.

I should also note that Trump’s joke about preferring veterans who didn’t get caught is a standard joke formula. My best guess is that he recognized the joke setup and it was too juicy to pass up. He probably also had a New Yorker’s blind spot to how that joke would be seen by the rest of the country. The thing that protected Trump from this joke becoming a bigger problem was that he had a strong record of backing veterans, and he continued to strengthen that association during the campaign. All communication depends on what we believe is in the mind of the person communicating. We believed Trump was sincere about his concern for veterans, and so he got a bit of a free pass for his offensive joke.

Here’s how I described the New York personality in my blog, two months after Trump announced his candidacy.

Posted August 5, 2015

The visceral reaction that makes so many people dislike Trump has a lot to do with his New York style. I grew up in upstate New York, and his style registers with me in a completely different way than it does with my California friends who can’t stand him. What I see is bluntness, honesty, some risk taking, and a competitive nature. I don’t hate any of that. In fact, I kind of like it.

I have blogged about making the transition from my New York personality to my California personality. New Yorkers tend to say whatever they think is true to whoever is standing nearby. Not much filter. Californians say what they think will make you feel good. The California way would feel like lying if it were not so well-meaning.

I certainly understand that Trump comes off as arrogant, obnoxious, and lots of other bad stuff. But over time, and compared with the liars onstage with him, you might get hooked on hearing his honest* opinions. That’s how the New York style works. At first you hate it because it seems so harsh. In time, you start to appreciate the honesty. And when you realize the harshness is not a signal of real evil—just a style—you tend to get over it. He won’t win over all of his haters, but I predict that his New York style will grow on people more than you would expect. You could say his style is his biggest problem, but it might be self-solving with time and exposure. He is getting both.

## HOW A TRAINED PERSUADER EVALUATES SCANDALS

In this chapter I evaluate the influence on voters of the fresher scandals that arose during the campaign. My opinions here are closer to art than science, since I have no way to measure the impact of any specific influence. If you asked voters which scandals changed their votes, they might give you confident answers, but you shouldn’t trust them. In emotion-charged situations such as elections, we decide first and rationalize later. Any poll on this topic would detect voter rationalizations, nothing more.

With that caveat, I think you might find it useful to see how a trained persuader evaluates scandals for their likely impact. Let’s look at a few.

### TRUMP’S TAXES
For decades, candidates for president of the United States regularly released their tax returns so voters could look for any signs of conflict of interest or wrongdoing.1 Trump broke with tradition by saying he would not release his returns, citing as his reason that he was under audit and things could change. Critics assumed he was hiding something important. Supporters either believed his tax returns were irrelevant or preferred that they stay hidden so Trump could prevail.

Persuasion-wise, Trump allowed opponents to imagine there were some bad things in his tax returns. That would be terrible persuasion technique unless the alternative is to give critics dozens of fresh targets—both real and imagined—by releasing the details.

The public at large is not savvy about business or corporate taxes. Trump’s critics would have cherry-picked elements from his returns and framed them as the work of a crook, even if they were legal. In the event that the IRS agreed that Trump’s tax strategies followed the law, critics could still find evidence on the returns that Trump was an ungenerous weasel. There was no way for Trump to win by releasing his tax returns.

Voters probably hate the IRS as much as Trump’s critics disliked Trump. And every taxpayer uses every available strategy to reduce taxes. On one hand, the unknowns about Trump’s taxes were worrisome. But that persuasion had no visual power and did not evoke any concrete fears, ones that went beyond the conceptual. On the other hand, a little bit of “fudging” on taxes probably made Trump more relatable to taxpayers accustomed to doing the same.

Overall, I think the persuasion impact of Trump’s taxes was low, especially in the context of so many other provocations and scandals that were visual and far juicier.

### KKK SLOW DENIAL
February 2016
In a televised interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Trump stumbled and hesitated on a question about disavowing the KKK and its former grand wizard, David Duke. Both had recently endorsed his campaign. Trump later claimed he had a defective earpiece and didn’t hear the question clearly. Critics said his hesitation to disavow was a clear sign that he was a racist. This event more than any other added fodder to the allegations that Trump is a racist.

For context, you should know that Trump had disavowed David Duke a number of times in the past, and the day after the Tapper interview he clearly disavowed both Duke and the KKK. He left no wiggle room.

The Tapper interview went like this.

Tapper: I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who recently said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage.

Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don’t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?

Trump: Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don’t know.

I don’t know, did he endorse me or what’s going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you’re asking me a question that I’m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.

Tapper: But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don’t know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don’t want their support?

Trump: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don’t know what group you’re talking about.

You wouldn’t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.

Tapper: The Ku Klux Klan?

Trump: But you may have groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know.

Tapper: Okay. I mean, I’m just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but . . .

Trump: I don’t know any—honestly, I don’t know David Duke. I don’t believe I have ever met him. I’m pretty sure I didn’t meet him. And I just don’t know anything about him.

Persuasion-wise, this was probably Trump’s biggest error of the campaign. When you see the interview live, or read the transcript, it does make you wonder what the heck he was thinking. But the one thing I feel comfortable saying is that he wasn’t planning to embrace the KKK and its past leader while running for president of the United States. That doesn’t make sense in any world in which Trump is sane. And I think he is sane.

Trump’s claim of a faulty earpiece probably sounds ridiculous to you. But I can tell you, from my own experience with hundreds of similar interviews, the connection is often bad, and you don’t realize how bad until you are in the interview. I can confirm that I have done live television interviews by satellite and found myself literally guessing what the question was because of a faulty connection. Far more times I have asked the engineer at the remote studio to try connecting on another line because the sound on the first one was unclear. So a “bad earpiece” is fairly common, assuming that is shorthand for any problem with the sound.

In the 2-D world where facts and logic matter, I found Trump’s explanation of a bad earpiece to be plausible, assuming he was referring to bad sound quality in general. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, this was his biggest campaign error. Even if you allow that he had trouble hearing the questions, it was a persuasion mistake to say he didn’t know enough about David Duke to disavow him. My best guess is that Trump was being consistent with his practice of never giving away anything until he can trade it for value. He needed every vote he could get, including votes from people who think and do things you and I don’t like. If that sounds terrible to you, keep in mind that Trump’s background is the construction business in New York. He has dealt with unsavory characters. And sometimes those unsavory characters are a small part of a larger plan for a greater good, whether you hate them or not. You can make up your own mind about the ethics of using bad people to get good outcomes.

This scandal was sticky because it played to the confirmation bias that Trump is a racist. And it fit nicely on the laundry list of “evidence” that Trump was up to something “dark.” This scandal probably changed some votes.

### JUDGE CURIEL
June 2016
The Trump University case ended up in the court of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an American citizen with Mexican-born parents. Trump complained that the judge might be biased because, as Trump put it, the judge is “Mexican.” This characterization was important to Trump because his flagship policy involved getting tough on illegal Mexican immigrants, and that made him deeply unpopular with Americans of Mexican heritage.

In the context of a legal case, lawyers routinely look for bias by association and try to limit it to achieve a fair trial. That’s why judges recuse themselves when there is either potential bias or the appearance of it. Most people agree with the idea that humans have bias, but when the concept is extended to include ethnicity as a variable, it violates our most basic instincts of fairness.

Critics decried Trump’s characterization of the judge as “Mexican,” saying it was both inaccurate and racist because the judge is an American citizen. Trump’s critics did a solid job of overinterpreting Trump’s comments to mean he was saying Mexicans in general are not capable of being fair judges. (Trump didn’t say that.)

To give this topic some context, ask any of your American friends of Italian heritage to describe their families. There’s a good chance they will refer to themselves as “Italian.” Ask any American-born friend with Mexican heritage to describe himself and there’s a good chance he will use the descriptor “Mexican.” Americans use this sort of shorthand all the time. Citizenship is a separate question.

My opinion on the Judge Curiel scandal is that Trump was using a shorthand way of describing a potential source of bias. I doubt Trump was questioning the judge’s citizenship. I think he was reminding us that it would be hard for Judge Curiel to rule in favor of Trump and still feel okay at the next Curiel family gathering. All humans have bias, and family-related bias is among our strongest instincts.

Judges are trained to think past their biases and apply the law. But judges are also human, so they can’t be expected to be biasfree simply because they are trained to act that way.

Trump’s outrageous claim that Judge Curiel might be biased because of his Mexican heritage was good legal strategy, in my opinion, albeit clumsily done. It created two potential outcomes. Either the judge would rule in Trump’s favor, or the groundwork had been laid for Trump to claim he lost only because of a biased judge.

Trump made a bad persuasion mistake when he referred to the judge as “Mexican” instead of calling him an American with Mexican heritage. But that mistake was somewhat balanced by the fact that he might have persuaded the judge to be extra fair to him or else be forever labeled biased.

Judge Curiel signaled that he planned to schedule the court case for the summer or early fall of 2016. The timing would have been terrible for Trump’s campaign. The dusty old Trump University scandal would have rapidly evolved into a new scandal in voters’ minds, complete with lots of visuals, details, and alleged victims. It could have been a disaster.

Trump’s lawyers argued for a delay until after the election. The judge was under no obligation to grant the delay. One could argue that he had a greater obligation to not treat Trump as special. There was no legal basis for granting a delay.

Judge Curiel granted the delay. And it probably saved the election for Trump.

You can say Trump made a mistake when he called out Judge Curiel’s potential bias by association. He definitely made a big mistake in the way he worded his objection. But Trump also made it nearly impossible for the judge to rule against Trump in any gray area. The court date was a gray area, and a judgment call. It went Trump’s way.

My best guess is that the net persuasion effect of this entire situation was positive for Trump. On one hand, it was a mistake to use the term “Mexican” as a shorthand for Mexican heritage and give his critics so much ammunition. But at the same time, Trump removed bigger weapons from his critics by taking the Trump University court case out of the election cycle. I think Trump actually won that chess game, but clumsily so. And it came with a big cost in his reputation for being “dark.”

Update: Tonight at dinner a young man at my table who was born and raised in America referred to himself as “Mexican” because he is 20 percent Hispanic by way of Mexico. Candidate Trump was talking about Judge Curiel the way normal people talk about themselves in casual conversations.

### KHAN CONTROVERSY
July 2016
At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, a Muslim American lawyer named Khizr Khan spoke movingly about how his son, an army captain, died a hero in 2004 in Iraq. The larger context of the speech involved pointed criticism of Trump and his policies.

Asked about Mr. Khan’s speech, Trump told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that Mr. Khan seemed like a “nice guy,” but he wondered aloud why Khan’s wife stood next to him and didn’t speak. Trump said, “If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably—maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say, you tell me.”

Trump’s implication was that the Khans’ religion stifles the free expression of women. Trump’s supporters probably found it amusing and on point. His critics called it racist and sexist and said he disrespected the parents of a fallen hero.

This is another example of how Trump sometimes makes an unforced error that has the effect of making voters focus where he wants them to focus. In this case, Trump wanted voters to believe Muslim immigration could bring with it some unpopular attitudes about gender. As long as people were thinking about that issue, Trump had an edge.

Unfortunately for Trump, this controversy fit nicely with Clinton’s “dark” persuasion and added to the confirmation bias. But Trump took some of the energy out of this scandal by using it to frame immigration as dangerous for women. Both sides used fear persuasion, but Clinton probably got the best of the exchange because her persuasion was a twofer: It painted Trump as disrespectful to a fallen military hero as well as racist.

Trump was somewhat protected from the criticism that he was disrespectful to a fallen military hero because he had done a great job of focusing on veterans’ issues during the campaign. This scandal probably didn’t change many votes.

### ANTHONY WEINER’S LAPTOP
August 2016
Anthony Weiner was the husband of Hillary Clinton’s closest adviser, Huma Abedin. Weiner allegedly got caught more than once sexting with women who were not his wife, including a teen girl.

I will skip the details.

Trump supporters tried with some success to put the stink of that scandal on Hillary Clinton by association. But Huma quietly left the campaign, and other scandals pushed this one off the top of the news. This one didn’t do much damage, in my opinion. But it might have made Trump’s upcoming Pussygate scandal less damaging because it lessened the contrast between Trump’s bad behavior and Hillary Clinton’s reputation by association.

### BASKET OF DEPLORABLES
September 2016
Speaking at the LGBT for Hillary gala in New York City on September 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton said that half of Trump’s supporters were “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.” She went on to call them a “basket of deplorables.” Trump responded by saying Clinton’s remarks showed “her true contempt for everyday Americans.”

Marriage experts will tell you that the best indicator of a future divorce is when the couple displays contempt for each other. Couples can get past most other types of problems with some work. But contempt is a reliable signal that a relationship is in serious trouble, say the experts.2

Hillary Clinton had just shown contempt for a large portion of the electorate. Trump, the Master Persuader, probably considered all of the ways he might frame Clinton’s “deplorables” comment for political advantage. He could have said it was awful, inappropriate, insulting, sick, or any one of dozens of descriptors. But he didn’t. He reached into the third dimension and plucked out the one word with the absolute strongest persuasion power: “contempt.”

I don’t have to tell you that the English language contains lots of words. But there was only one best word for this situation. Trump probably found it. He once famously said he “has the best words.” In the second dimension, that claim is false. In the third dimension, Trump does indeed have the best words. He proved it once again with his choice of the word “contempt.”

It was perfect. And it wasn’t luck.

After the election, Clinton’s “deplorables” speech was often mentioned on social media as a reason that people voted for Trump. In the 2-D world, that would seem to make sense. But in the 3-D world of persuasion, the “deplorables” comment might have been what I call a “fake because.” In other words, it was a rationalization for what people wanted to do anyway. History will record that the “deplorables” comment might have changed the election. The Persuasion Filter agrees it might have, but it also might have simply given Trump supporters cover for the vote they wanted to cast anyway.

Soon after the “deplorables” comment, I got on a Periscope live stream and noted that many Trump supporters were deplorable, sure, but they were “adorable deplorables.”

“Adorable deplorables” became one of the many positive spins that Trump supporters put on Clinton’s contemptuous comment. The “deplorables” insult turned into memes and clothing for Trump supporters, and it happened within hours.

Clinton’s “deplorables” comment was a persuasion mistake of epic proportions. It validated what many Trump supporters suspected: Clinton didn’t simply disagree with Republicans; she literally had no respect for a large percentage of them. And that doesn’t work if you are running to be the leader of the entire country.

WIKILEAKS, CLINTON, COMEY, AND RUSSIA
This scandal had its roots before the election. I’ll show you the time line, for context, before we get to the fresh stuff.

In March 2015, during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, she used her private e-mail server for official communications. Those official communications included thousands of e-mails that would retroactively be marked “classified” by the State Department.

On July 5, 2016, FBI Director Comey announced that the FBI’s investigation had concluded that Clinton was “extremely careless” in handling her e-mail system but recommended that no charges be filed against her.

On July 6, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that no charges would be filed.

On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered e-mails found on a laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s husband, Anthony Weiner, during an investigation of his sexting scandals.

On November 6, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion, reached in July, regarding Clinton’s e-mails.

Over the summer of 2016, Wikileaks teased that it had access to e-mails from the Democratic National Committee’s e-mail server with explosive revelations. Wikileaks trickled out the e-mails in small batches to keep the public engaged.

The worst thing we heard (that was credible) from the hacked DNC e-mails was that Clinton supporter and CNN pundit Donna Brazile had shared an upcoming primary debate question with candidate Clinton. As bombshells go, that was a small one. But it did add fuel to Trump’s claim that the media was against him.

The hacked DNC e-mails also sparked the so-called Pizzagate allegation that high-ranking Democrats were engaged in a cult that involved satanic worship, sexual abuse of children, and pizza. This story got a lot of attention, but it probably didn’t achieve enough credibility to influence many votes. Personally, I didn’t believe any of it.

Clinton’s e-mail scandal was confusing to the public, and I think it got conflated in people’s minds with the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC’s e-mail server that got released to Wikileaks. Add all of that to the Clinton Foundation allegations, and the public started feeling as if something wasn’t quite right with the Clintons. Trump helped that impression along with his branding of Hillary Clinton as crooked. The public heard complicated news reports they didn’t understand, but it looked to them as if they were seeing plenty of smoke, so there must be fire.

Notice how “crooked” became a sponge for soaking up confirmation bias. It worked as well as “dark” worked on the other side. Both are examples of weapons-grade persuasion.

Hillary Clinton and her supporters, along with many pundits and voters, believe that Comey’s reopening of the e-mail investigation because of new e-mails found on Weiner’s laptop cost Clinton the election. Clinton’s poll numbers dropped right after the Comey announcement. But in the third dimension, Comey’s actions were probably a “fake because” that people used to vote the way they had already decided to vote. In my opinion, Comey was not hugely influential to the outcome. But history will probably say he was.

### MISS UNIVERSE CONTROVERSY
September 2016
Hillary Clinton mentioned in a presidential debate that back in 1996 Trump had called a Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, “Miss Piggy” because of her weight gain. Trump owned the Miss Universe contest in those days, and when his winner gained weight, it was problematic for the brand. As we later learned, Trump was flexible with Machado at the time and tried to work with her to keep her title and support her in losing weight. But Trump’s critics characterized him as being disrespectful to women.

Trump’s supporters didn’t find this issue terribly important because they figured a spokesperson for a beauty contest probably has some responsibility to stay in shape. And they weren’t bothered by any politically incorrect things said about the issue.

Clinton’s supporters found in this one more bit of evidence (or confirmation bias) for Trump’s general awfulness. But I doubt this scandal changed many votes, if any.

### PUSSYGATE: THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD RECORDING
October 2016
A month before election day, the Washington Post released an audio recording in which Trump and television host Billy Bush had a lewd private conversation about women in 2005. Both men were wearing microphones for an upcoming TV segment and didn’t realize they were being recorded.

In the audio, Trump boasted about his star appeal and its effect on women, saying, “I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. . . . Grab them by the pussy.”

Trump’s critics and other observers described Trump’s statements as confessions of sexual abuse. Trump’s supporters dismissed it as meaningless “locker room talk.” Trump issued a statement apologizing for the audio’s content in which he reduced its power by adding a contrast adjustment. He said Bill Clinton had “said far worse to me on the golf course.”

This was the most damaging scandal for Trump. It erupted only a month before election day, so the timing was ideal for the Clinton camp. It had a strong visual component, both because we saw video of Trump with Billy Bush after the comments and because we reflexively imagine Trump grabbing a woman in an inappropriate way. And it fit into the “dark” framing with the rest of Trump’s alleged bad behavior.

But it wasn’t entirely bad, for a reason that isn’t obvious in the second dimension. Until this scandal broke, the main objection to Trump was that he was literally a Hitler-like strongman leader in waiting. The Access Hollywood tape had the unintended effect of humanizing Trump and taking people’s minds from the Hitler frame to the “flawed guy” frame.

Had the Access Hollywood tape been the only scandal of the campaign, it might have been decisive. But in the context of a Trump-is-Hitler framing, it may have taken some of the scare off of him by moving people’s impression of him from Hitler-like strongman to flawed male. That’s a promotion.

As bad as the scandal was, I find it hard to know for sure whether it helped Trump or hurt him. My best guess is that it cost him votes, but it was less of a problem than people assumed it would be. Part of what protected Trump from that scandal is that some form of bad-boy sexual behavior was already baked into what we assumed about him. He never presented himself as an angel. It would have been a fatal mistake if he had.

If you look at the scandals individually, they seem like the types of things that can move elections. But collectively they involve too much information for voters to process. So instead, voters likely defaulted to their biases. Both candidates created plenty of fodder for confirmation bias. Clinton’s scandals made her look more “crooked” every day, while Trump’s scandals contributed to his “dark” reputation. The main standout among the scandals, in my opinion, was Clinton’s “deplorables” speech. Voters expect a certain amount of sketchy behavior from their leaders and discount it in their minds. But no one discounts contempt when they hear it.

## HOW TO WIN BY A HAIR(CUT)
From a persuasion perspective, we can’t ignore President Trump’s famous haircut and what I assume was a fake tan of some sort. Early on in the race, both his hair and face registered in our minds as orange. And that’s a problem if you are trying to be taken seriously as a representative of the country. But like many problems, this one presented an opportunity. Trump could solve his distracting haircut and his oversized ego with one simple act: He could shave his head. I whimsically but seriously suggested exactly that, more than a year before election day.

On August 5, 2015, I blogged . . .

If Trump wants the independents and some Democrats to vote his way, he needs something bigger. He needs a trump card.

And he has it.

His hair.

I believe Donald Trump could become president of the United States if he promised to shave his head upon winning. Or perhaps he could do it a month before the election to suck all the media attention from his competitor.

Right. Think about it. Voters are emotional creatures and they would love such an act of humility coming from such an egotistical jerk. People love to see other people change. That is the formula for successful movies: The protagonist changes when the audience thinks such change is not possible. We LOVE that.

As it turned out, Trump did not need to shave his head to win. But he did improve his haircut during the campaign. And it looks like he dyed it a blonder shade. He also fixed his fake tan, or whatever was making him orange. Today you don’t see the orange. I think this slow transformation was a big help in his win. We like to think we are rational voters, but that haircut in its severe original form would have scared people away. Trump solved that (to some extent), as Master Persuaders do. By election day the nonstop ridicule of Trump’s hair had slowed to nearly nothing. We got used to his appearance, while at the same time he evolved to a less distracting look. Most people probably didn’t notice the change.

## HOW TO CREATE TWO WAYS TO WIN, NO WAY TO LOSE

One of Trump’s most entertaining persuasion strategies is what I call “Two Ways to Win, No Way to Lose.” I’ll give you some examples.

In January of 2016, Iran briefly detained ten American sailors for entering Iranian waters. Candidate Trump cleverly staked out the position that if Iran didn’t release the sailors soon, he would make Iran pay for its treachery when he became president. With this setup, one of two things could happen:

Iran might keep the sailors in custody through the election, allowing Trump to use it as an example of why American voters need to elect a badass, such as Trump, to deal with Iran, or . . .
Iran might release the sailors before the election, and Trump could claim it did so because of his tough talk.
Iran released the sailors fifteen hours after they were captured. Trump immediately suggested that his tough talk had made a difference.

In an earlier chapter, I talked about Trump using the two-ways-to-win technique with his criticism of the judge in his Trump University case. By questioning the judge’s impartiality before the case was heard, Trump created two ways to win:

Trump’s accusation of bias could cause the judge to overcompensate to avoid the appearance of bias and rule in Trump’s favor, or . . .
If Trump didn’t get the verdict he wanted, he could later claim the reason was the judge’s bias.
Trump fumbled on this play by referring to the judge as “Mexican.” But that is a separate issue. His two-ways-to-win strategy would have been a solid approach had he avoided that unforced error.

As I write this chapter, Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan is taking the lead in putting together a first pass of a health-care bill that is intended to replace Obamacare. Trump is being hands off on the details, allowing Ryan to get branded with whatever plans come out of the first few iterations and negotiations. One of two things can happen:

Ryan succeeds with a health-care bill that is surprisingly bipartisan, and the country feels it is an improvement over Obamacare (in which case the Trump administration looks great; presidents take credit for good things that happen during their administrations), or . . .
Ryan’s plans fail miserably in the court of public opinion. In that case, President Trump can step in and start moving both sides to the middle. The Republicans would be softened up by their recent failure, and Democrats would be scared to death that their only options are the stingy Republican plan that doesn’t cover enough people and no health-care plan at all. Having softened up both sides, Trump gives himself room to find the middle.
At this writing, I am not predicting that Trump will easily swoop in and find a middle path for health care that gets enough votes to pass. I’m suggesting that the only way a compromise health-care bill is possible is if Trump lets Ryan go first and fail hard, while scaring the bejeezus out of the Democrats at the same time. In this context, the two ways to win are the passing of a Ryan bill that is surprisingly bipartisan and the softening up of both sides to make the middle easier to find.

For your reference, I wrote this chapter in March of 2017. By the time you read it, you’ll know how things are unfolding.

Much of Trump’s business revenue comes from licensing the Trump name to various products and projects. License deals are unique in the sense that they give you two ways to win and (almost) no way to lose. That’s because license deals generally have some big up-front payments that are guaranteed at the signing of the deal, with potential for more fees if the business or project is profitable. That looks like this:

If the business that licenses Trump’s name fails, Trump’s company keeps all the license payments that have been paid so far (and that typically includes a large up-front payment), or . . .
If the business succeeds, Trump’s company makes even more money because the license continues to pay out as a percentage of profits.
I have done similar licensing deals for Dilbert products for years, and for the same reason. Similarly, as an established author, I also get paid for my books before I write them. If the book does poorly, I keep the large up-front advance. If the book is a huge best seller, I make even more money in ongoing royalties. I have two ways to win and no way to lose.

When Trump dabbled in running for president in prior election cycles, he also had two ways to win and no way to lose. If he didn’t get any traction in the polls, he still raised his profile and the value of his brand. In his earlier flirtations with running for president, you didn’t see him being so provocative with his policies as he was with his successful run in 2016. The earlier efforts were low-risk, high-reward plays. By “losing” early in prior election cycles, he still put his name in everyone’s mind for the next time. He was literally winning by losing.

When candidate Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he didn’t play it safe. He went the opposite direction. This created the impression that he had only one way to win. He had to get elected president, or else he would get nothing out of the exercise but a tainted reputation, thanks to his enemies branding him as a racist for his immigration proposals. But at age seventy, Trump’s objectives in life appear to be more focused on the public good (believe it or not). I have heard this from reliable sources. If those insider accounts are accurate, Trump gave himself two ways to win and no way to lose, at least in terms of the public good as he sees it. It looks like this:

If Trump lost the election, he would still influence the public’s perception about the importance of border security. If we assume Trump is sincere about better border security being a public necessity, he wins by making it a more prominent issue in our minds. In this scenario, the Trump brand might suffer in the short run, but it would also likely recover.
If Trump won the election, which he did, he would get to influence the country more directly.
In the interest of clarity, I’ll acknowledge that “no way to lose” isn’t an absolute. Life can always find a way to trip you up. But if you are playing the odds, always look for situations that give you two ways to win and almost no way to lose.

I sometimes describe this situation in a more generic sense as having a system instead of a goal. A goal is, by definition, one way to win and infinite ways to lose. A good system gives you lots of ways to win and far fewer ways to fail. An example of a good system is going to college and getting an engineering degree. You don’t yet know what your ultimate career will be, but the engineering degree gives you lots of ways to win while vastly reducing the number of ways to lose. You don’t see many homeless engineers. And if you do, it involves substance abuse or mental issues.

I write in detail about the advantage of systems over goals in my book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big.

> PERSUASION TIP 24
> If you can frame your preferred strategy as two ways to win and no way to lose, almost no one will disagree with your suggested path because it is a natural High-Ground Maneuver.

The next time you are in a discussion about strategy, either in business or in your personal life, listen to everyone else’s suggestions and then top them with a “two ways to win, no way to lose” play, assuming your situation allows for that. You’ll find that it ends every strategy discussion. No one picks one way to win and infinite ways to lose if they have an option of two ways to win and no way to lose.

## HOW TO USE THE HIGH-GROUND MANEUVER

If you have siblings, or you have more than one child of your own, you know kids like to use the “fairness” argument to get whatever their siblings already got. Most parents cave in and try to balance things right away. That’s like arming a child with a powerful persuasion weapon. The kid will trot out the fairness argument at every opportunity.

My mother had a different approach. When my siblings or I complained about the unfairness of one thing or another, she would tell us bluntly that “life isn’t fair.” End of story. We were disarmed before the first shot was fired. That method is what I call the High-Ground Maneuver. It takes the debate out of the details—the weeds, I call them—and elevates it to the high ground where there is no disagreement. On the next page you can see how I wrote about the High-Ground Maneuver in 2010, right after Apple had its famous “Antennaegate” public relations fiasco. Watch Steve Jobs take the high ground. This is magnificent persuasion.


Posted July 19, 2010

I’m sure you’re all following the iPhone 4 story. If you hold the phone a certain way, it drops calls.

In a press conference on the subject, Steve Jobs said, “We’re not perfect. Phones are not perfect. We all know that. But we want to make our users happy.”

Jobs got a lot of heat about his response. Where was the apology? Where was the part where he acknowledged that the buck stops with him, and that Apple made a big mistake that never should have happened? That’s Public Relations 101, right?

I’m a student of how language influences people. Apple’s response to the iPhone 4 problem didn’t follow the public relations playbook because Jobs decided to rewrite the playbook. (I pause now to insert the necessary phrase “magnificent bastard.”) If you want to know what genius looks like, study Jobs’s words: “We’re not perfect. Phones are not perfect. We all know that. But we want to make our users happy.”

Jobs changed the entire argument with nineteen words. He was brief. He spoke indisputable truth. And later in his press conference, he offered clear fixes.

Did it work? Check out the media response. There’s lots of talk about whether other smartphones are perfect or not. There’s lots of talk about whether Jobs’s response was the right one. But the central question that was in everyone’s head before the press conference—“Is the iPhone 4 a dud?”—has, well, evaporated. Part of the change in attitude is because the fixes Apple offered are adequate. But those fixes easily could have become part of the joke if handled in an apologetic “please kick me” way.

If Jobs had not changed the context from the iPhone 4 in particular to all smartphones in general, I could make you a hilarious comic strip about a product so poorly made that it won’t work if it comes in contact with a human hand. But as soon as the context is changed to “all smartphones have problems,” the humor opportunity is gone. Nothing kills humor like a general and boring truth.

I’ve wondered for some time if Jobs studied hypnosis or if he’s some sort of freakish natural. And I wonder how much of his language is planned versus off-the-cuff. He speaks and acts like a master hypnotist. (For new readers, I’m a trained hypnotist myself, and it definitely takes one to know one.)

I have long had a name for Jobs’s clever move. I call it the “High-Ground Maneuver.” I first noticed an executive using it years ago, and I’ve since used it a number of times when the situation called for it. The move involves taking an argument up to a level where you can say something that is absolutely true while changing the context at the same time. Once the move has been executed, the other participants will fear appearing small-minded if they drag the argument back to the detail level. It’s an instant game changer.

For example, if a military drone accidentally kills civilians, and there is a public outcry, it would be a mistake for the military to spend too much time talking about what went wrong with that particular mission. The High-Ground Maneuver would go something like this: “War is messy. No one wants civilians to die. We will study this situation to see how we can better avoid it in the future.”

Notice that the response is succinct and indisputably true and that the context has been taken to a higher level, about war in general. That’s what Jobs did. It’s a powerful technique, and you can use it at home.

There’s a limit to the method. I don’t think that BP could have gotten away with it as a response to the oil spill because the problem was so large and it seemed unique to BP. But if they had tried the High-Ground Maneuver, it would have looked like this: “All of the easy sources of oil had been found by fifty years ago. If the oil industry stops taking risks, many of you would be out of work in less than a decade. We all want a future of clean energy, but no one sees a way to get there as quickly as we need to. We will do everything we can to clean up the spill and to make things right with the gulf economy.”

Someday business students will read about Steve Jobs’s response to the iPhone 4 issue and they will learn that the High-Ground Maneuver (probably by some other name) became the public relations standard for consumer-products companies from that day on.

Did I read too much into Jobs’s handling of this customer-relations nightmare? It’s possible. But if you read the Walter Isaacson biography Jobs, you’ll discover that Jobs personally forwarded my blog post to his subordinates. I don’t think he would have done that if he thought I was wrong.

## A GRAB BAG OF TRUMP’S QUICKEST AND EASIEST PERSUASION TOOLS
In this chapter I will give you a quick summary of some of Trump’s persuasion tools that don’t fit into any other chapter.

### SOCIAL PROOF (“MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING . . .”)
Trump likes to tell us that many people agree with whatever he’s telling us at the moment. That’s an example of “social proof” persuasion. Humans are wired to assume that if lots of people are saying the same thing, it must be true. In Trump’s case, he probably exaggerates the number of people who are agreeing with him. But the exaggerations don’t hurt him. If you are skeptical of his claim that others agree with him, and you look into it, you’ll certainly find some people who agree with him. And that’s enough to bias your mind in that direction. At the very least, it tells you that other reasonable people see things the way he does.

Trump didn’t have credibility with the entire country when he was campaigning, and he still doesn’t. So it helps him to frame himself as the one agreeing with the majority instead of coming up with questionable opinions on his own.

### ASK DIRECTLY FOR WHAT YOU WANT (“BELIEVE ME . . .”)
PERSUASION TIP 25
If you are selling, ask your potential customer to buy. Direct requests are persuasive.

Trump likes to punctuate the ends of his statements with “believe me.” That’s a direct command disguised as throwaway words. One of the rules of selling is that at some point in the pitch you have to directly ask for what you want. Trump wants you to believe him. So he asks directly. That seems like no big deal until you realize how easy it would be for him to not ask people to believe him. That’s how most politicians operate. They say what they want to say and then they hope you believe it. Trump takes it one step further, using perfect persuasion technique, and directly asks you to believe him.

This form of persuasion isn’t one of the most powerful. But keep in mind that campaigning is about finding ten messages that move one half of 1 percent of voters your way per message.

### REPETITION (“IT’S TRUE. IT’S TRUE.”)
> PERSUASION TIP 26
> Repetition is persuasion. Also, repetition is persuasion. And have I mentioned that repetition is persuasion?

Trump sometimes ends his statements by saying, “It’s true. It’s true.” That’s because repetition is persuasion. If you frequently hear that a thing is true, it biases you to think there might be something to it.

### SIMPLICITY
At the start of Trump’s campaign, the critics were vicious in attacking his seemingly limited vocabulary and his simple statements. Journalists wrote stories that described Trump’s speaking style as below the level of a sixth-grader.1 The implication was that Trump was simpleminded.

I might have been the first public figure to point out that Trump’s simple language was perfect persuasion. Here’s why.

> PERSUASION TIP 27
> Match the speaking style of your audience. Once they see you as one of their own, it will be easier to lead them.

Trump spoke the way the majority of voters speak.

Trump’s simple speaking style made him relatable to the average undereducated voter. This is another example of Trump using pacing and leading. First you match your audience to gain their trust. Then you can lead them. This is powerful persuasion.

### SIMPLER LOOKS RIGHT

Our minds are wired to believe that the simplest explanation for events is probably the correct one. This belief even has a name: Occam’s razor. In the context of science, the simplest explanation that explains your observations is more likely to be right than the one with hundreds of variables and assumptions. But when you take Occam’s razor to the nonscience world, it quickly becomes nonsense. The reality is that we humans fool ourselves into thinking that the explanation of the world we hold in our minds is usually the simplest one. But that is an illusion. Let me give you some examples to make that point.

If I ask you where life on Earth came from, you might say God did it. That’s the simplest explanation, and billions of people believe it. But a nonbeliever would not find that so simple. He might ask where God came from. He might ask why God decided to create a world of creatures he loved while also making them the food source for each other. Nothing is ever simple when you dig into it.

Suppose I ask a nonbeliever how life formed. He might say evolution did it. Simple! But that masks a lot of complexity in how DNA mutates, how species compete and reproduce, how eyeballs formed, and more. My simple truth might look like a complicated mess to you. And vice versa. It’s subjective.

> PERSUASION TIP 28
> Simple explanations look more credible than complicated ones.

I used Occam’s razor in writing my book God’s Debris. The main character in that fictional story is written as the smartest person alive. But since I am not the smartest person alive, and I had to write dialogue for a character who was, I had a problem. I don’t know what the smartest person in the world would say! How could I? So I used Occam’s razor to create the illusion that the character was smart. He explained reality in such simple terms that they register as being persuasive to the reader. The simplicity itself carries credibility, even though it doesn’t earn it.

### MEMORABLE
One of the special features of Trump’s speaking style is that it is naturally viral. The way he words things—especially the simplicity of it—makes his points easy to remember and easy to repeat. He’s a human quote machine. On Twitter his supporters routinely end their tweets with a Trump catchword: Sad!

> PERSUASION TIP 29
> Simplicity makes your ideas easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to spread. You can be persuasive only when you are also memorable.

As I mentioned earlier in the book, Trump branded his opponents with easy-to-remember labels including “crooked,” “low-energy,” “lying,” “little,” and “goofy.” Had he chosen more complex criticisms, we wouldn’t quote him, and the ideas would stay walled off in the garden of intellectual thinkers. But if you call a political opponent “Fake-tears Schumer,” you know it will go viral. And it did.

### STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY
In the early days of the Republican primary season, there were plenty of Republicans who wanted to support Trump, but their policy preferences didn’t align with his. You can’t please the people who want policy X at the same time as the people who hate policy X. Trump solved that (partly) by telling everyone what they wanted to hear. It was shamelessly effective persuasion. Here’s how I described it at the time.

Posted March 1, 2016

If you have been watching the news lately, you know that Donald Trump disavowed the endorsement of racist David Duke. Unless you are watching CNN, in which case, their version of the news is that he didn’t do enough disavowing that one time.

If you’re a racist, you have a reason to like Trump because of CNN’s misreporting, and the fact that Trump didn’t do enough disavowing that one time. If you’re not a racist, you can like Trump because he disavowed racists several times, in writing and on video.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

If you hate socialized health care, you might like Trump because he hates socialized medicine too. Except that he also says he won’t let people with no money “die on the streets.” So if you like socialized medicine, you might like giving free health care to those people, like Trump.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

If you hate illegal immigrants, you might like Trump because he once said he will deport every one of them. But if you feel compassion for undocumented immigrants who are otherwise good residents of the country, Trump’s administration is focusing only on the ones who committed additional crimes after illegally entering the country.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

If you oppose war, you might like Trump because he claims he opposed the Iraq war and he says he has a history of being reluctant to commit U.S. forces overseas. But if you think the United States should keep bombing other countries, Trump might be your candidate, because he wants to “bomb the shit out of ISIS” and maybe kill some of their families too.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

If you want a religious president, Trump can give you that. He has belonged to a church since youth and he says the Bible is a “great book.” But if you don’t like mixing religion and politics, Trump might be your candidate, because he hasn’t made a big deal about religion.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

I could go on like this for another hour or so, but I think you get the picture. And when you see the pattern, you realize none of it is by accident. Trump intentionally gives opposing sides reasons to like him, or at least not disqualify him. And as ridiculous as it seems for a strategy, it works like a charm because of confirmation bias. People see whatever they want to see.

You might be aware that I have been saying good things about Donald Trump’s persuasion skills for months. This has led many people to believe I endorse Trump for president.

But earlier this week [Note: This was written in March of 2016] I disavowed Trump for his strategic ambiguity on racism. So if you hate Trump, you can be okay with me because I disavowed him. And if you love Trump, you can be okay with me because I say good things about his talent on a regular basis.

That’s strategic ambiguity.

Now you know why I disavowed Trump for not disavowing racism hard enough that one time, even though he clearly disavowed it before and after the time he did not disavow it so clearly. The facts were never important to me. I ignored the facts publicly and shamelessly because doing so provided me the best possible outcome: strategic ambiguity.

> PERSUASION TIP 30
> “Strategic ambiguity” refers to a deliberate choice of words that allows people to read into your message whatever they want to hear. Or to put it another way, the message intentionally leaves out any part that would be objectionable to anyone. People fill in the gaps with their imagination, and their imagination can be more persuasive than anything you say.

Strategic ambiguity is especially useful when you are trying to persuade lots of people at the same time, and they all have different hot buttons. How will Trump make America great again? The answer: any way you want it to happen. I might imagine that Trump improves the economy, because that’s what I care about, while you imagine he defeats ISIS, because you think that is the top priority. With Trump, you get to fill in the blanks with your most potent self-hypnosis.
