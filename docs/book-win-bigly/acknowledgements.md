# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Thank you to all the “deplorables” who made this book possible. You supported me on social media when the going got tough, and you refused to settle for the status quo. You were fearless, smart, and funny. Many of you asked me to write this book, and I was honored to do so. I hope you like what I did with our story.

Thank you to my prescient publisher, Adrian Zackheim, for knowing how to nudge me in exactly the right ways. Thank you to my brilliant editor, Leah Trouwborst, for helping me turn my raw thoughts into a compelling story. And thank you to Chris Morgan for fact-checking along the way to keep me out of trouble.

Thank you to the many haters who came after me during the 2016 election and after. You energized me. Sometimes art needs an enemy.

Thank you to America, for making all of this fun possible. You were already great, but the best is yet to come.

We’re just getting started.
