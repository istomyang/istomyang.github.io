## APPENDIX A
The Persuasion Reading List
Whenever I write about persuasion, readers ask what else they can read on the topic. So I put together what I call the Persuasion Reading List. I haven’t read every book on this list. Some are included because the content fits the topic and includes the sort of lessons I have absorbed through different channels.

BOOKS THAT HELP YOU STOP BELIEVING

The first books on my list will help you to be skeptical about your ability to comprehend reality. If you are already a hard-core skeptic, you can skip these.

An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (James Randi)

They Got It Wrong: History: All the Facts that Turned Out to Be Myths (Emma Marriott)

THE MOIST ROBOT HYPOTHESIS

The Moist Robot Hypothesis first appears in my book that is listed below. The idea is that humans are biological machines, subject to cause and effect. According to this view, free will is an illusion and humans can be programmed once you understand our user interface.

In this part of the list, I ease you into the notion that humans are mindless robots by showing you how we are influenced by design, habit, emotion, food, and words. Until you accept the moist robot view of the world, it will be hard to use your tools of persuasion effectively.

The Design of Everyday Things (Don Norman)

What Every BODY Is Saying (Joe Navarro)

The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business (Charles Duhigg)

Influence (Robert B. Cialdini, PhD)

Pre-Suasion (Robert B. Cialdini, PhD)

Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

Salt Sugar Fat (Michael Moss)

How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life (Scott Adams)

Free Will (Sam Harris)

Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions (Dan Ariely)

A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Burton G. Malkiel)

The Black Swan (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

### ACTIVE PERSUASION

This part of the list gets into the details of how to influence people. My opinion is that you will not be completely effective with these tools unless you have a full understanding of our moist robot nature, introduced above.

Impossible to Ignore (Dr. Carmen Simon)

Trump: The Art of the Deal (Donald J. Trump with Tony Schwartz)

Win Your Case: How to Present, Persuade, and Prevail—Every Place, Every Time (Gerry Spence)

Awaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial Destiny! (Tony Robbins)

How to Win Friends & Influence People (Dale Carnegie) (Better yet, take a Dale Carnegie class near you. It will change your life. Trust me.)

How to Write a Good Advertisement (Victor O. Schwab)

The Secret of Selling Anything (Harry Browne)

The One Sentence Persuasion Course: 27 Words to Make the World Do Your Bidding (Blair Warren)

Reframing: Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Transformation of Meaning (Richard Bandler and John Grinder) (This is included for completeness. Much of the NLP field has exaggerated claims, but there is some strong reality at the base of it.)

How to Hypnotise Anyone: Confessions of a Rogue Hypnotist (The Rogue Hypnotist) (I have not read this book, but based on reviews, it probably gives you a good taste of the topic. Do not expect to be a capable hypnotist after reading a book.)

Hypnosis and Accelerated Learning (Pierre Clement) (This is the flavor of hypnosis I learned in hypnosis class. It comes from Ericksonian hypnosis. See next book on list.)

Speak Ericksonian: Mastering the Hypnotic Methods of Milton Erickson (Richard Nongard and James Hazlerig) (Erickson was the father of modern hypnosis. Any book about his methods would be interesting.)

## APPENDIX B

How to Be a Better Writer
Good writing is also persuasive writing. People will judge your credibility by the quality of your writing. And you need credibility to persuade.

As you learned in this book, President Trump communicates in a style that is simple, provocative, visual, and quotable. Some of that is probably a natural talent. But it turns out that good writing is one of the easiest things to learn. You’re about to become a better writer, and it will be as easy as reading my blog post on the topic from 2007, presented below. This post has been widely shared on the Internet since it first appeared. I recommend rereading it about once a year to keep your mind tuned to good form.

Posted on June 16, 2007

I went from being a bad writer to being a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.” I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you don’t have to waste a day in class.

Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it.

Simple means getting rid of extra words. Don’t write “He was very happy” when you can write “He was happy.” You think the word “very” adds something. It doesn’t. Prune your sentences.

Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, don’t say “drink” when you can say “swill.”

Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence in this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious. That’s the key.

Write short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers aren’t as smart as you’d think.

Learn how brains organize ideas. Readers comprehend “the boy hit the ball” quicker than “the ball was hit by the boy.” Both sentences mean the same thing, but it’s easier to imagine the actor (the boy) before the action (the hitting). All brains work that way. (Notice I didn’t say, “That is the way all brains work”?)

That’s it. You just learned 80 percent of the rules of good writing. You’re welcome.

## APPENDIX C
How to Find Out if You Are a Simulation
I often blog about the idea that we might be computer simulations. If we are simulations, how could we deduce our true nature? I took a run at that question in this blog post of April 27, 2017:

Regular readers of this blog know about philosopher Nick Bostrom’s idea that it is far more likely we are simulations created by an advanced species than that we are the original species itself. The reasoning here is that every sufficiently advanced species will create multiple simulations in which the simulated creatures believe they are real. So the odds are high that we are one of the many simulations, not the original species that created them.

But how could you tell?

I have a hypothesis. There should be a difference in how a real species and a simulated species views its own history. The real species would have a real history with full details. The simulation would have something closer to history on demand. And by that I mean the history comes into existence only when current circumstances require that history. If we are software simulations, the simulator presumably has resource constraints. That means the simulation would not create every part of the universe just in case it is needed; it would create what is needed on demand. For example, a simulated universe would not contain details about undiscovered planets. Those details would be rendered by the simulation at the time of discovery.

To put this in simpler terms, if we are real, the past influences what we do in the present. But if we are simulations, what we do in the present could be creating the past.

For example, here’s an article [link omitted for book] describing how quantum physicists have determined that the present creates the past as needed. Freaky, right?

If we are simulations, we should expect to see two additional qualities in the universe as partial confirmation:

1. We should expect that we can’t travel past the boundaries of the simulation.

2. We wouldn’t be able to observe the basic building blocks of our reality.

Sure enough, we meet both criteria.

We can’t travel beyond the edge of the universe without exceeding the speed of light, which is theoretically impossible. That’s what you would expect in a simulation. You would have some sort of rule of physics to keep the simulated people from traveling beyond the edges. Here I’m assuming the universe is expanding at the same rate as the light that is traveling in all directions, so we can never catch up to it.

The hypothetical creators of our simulation would also try to prevent us from discovering that we are not made of anything real. And sure enough, when science looks at our basic building blocks at the quantum level, all we have is probability and strangeness.

I have viewed the world as having backward causation (the present creates the past) since I was a young man. In my worldview, an envelope you receive in the mail doesn’t have definite contents until it is observed. Up until the moment someone sees the contents, the envelope can contain anything that known history has not yet ruled out. This model of the world explains my observations every bit as well as the idea that the past determines my future.

In a simulated reality, we would expect to see lots of confirmation bias and lots of cognitive dissonance. Do you know why?

It keeps the programming simple for the author of our reality.

If we simulations saw our personal experiences accurately, the author of the simulation would have to make your view of history and mine fit together and be consistent on every variable. That would be massively complicated with billions of simulated humans doing things that create their histories on the fly. The solution to that complexity is to allow the simulated humans to hallucinate that whatever they observe coincidentally fits both their histories and their worldviews. That way the simulation doesn’t need to create accurate histories for all the players. We can imagine our own histories as being accurate until events in the present make that impossible. Then, and only then, does the simulation decide on a definite past.

Consider the news this week that a recent discovery suggests humans were in North America 100,000 years earlier than scientists believed. That finding is not yet confirmed, but it still works to make my point. Given that this new finding is not yet confirmed, our human history does not need to be rewritten by the simulation. But if new discoveries confirm that humans were in North America this early, our “real” history comes into existence at the moment our observations make it impossible for any other history to be true. Until then, both histories (and more) exist as probabilities, nothing more.

I assume I got some (or all) of the science wrong in this blog post. The only point I want to defend is the idea that a simulated universe would probably need to create its history based on current events, whereas a “real” universe would have an objective history that never changes.

## APPENDIX D
Trump’s Many Mistakes
I know from experience that some readers will complain I am too generous about President Trump’s talents and I am glossing over his flaws and mistakes. But keep in mind this is not a book about politics. My topic is persuasion, and in that field, Trump does far more right than wrong. I’m not qualified to judge the impact of his policies. I assume some will be better than others. His policies don’t often align with my own preferences. Don’t look to me to defend Republican politics.

Trump’s many “mistakes” can be misleading. For example, he knows that saying provocative and often untrue statements will attract energy—which is good—but it comes with a high cost. You can’t evaluate the costs of Trump’s persuasion systems independently of the benefits. You have to look at the net.

For example, Trump’s unscripted and provocative rally speeches were guaranteed to produce some gaffes—both the real and “fake news” kind—but the gain from being spontaneous and freewheeling probably provided more energy and persuasion advantage than downside. Had he been a more cautious candidate, he might have avoided a number of provocations and gaffes, but he also wouldn’t have energized his base. Do you score those gaffes as mistakes, or are they a known and acceptable cost of the persuasion strategy he was using? The economist in me looks at the net gain after all costs and benefits are included. His critics focus on the mistakes, and I mostly agree with their identification of the mistakes, give or take a few “fake news” misinterpretations of what he did.

I mentioned in my chapter on scandals that Trump fumbled on several plays. I’ll note them here for completeness. I won’t re-explain why these are not the mistakes they were reported to be in the mainstream media. I’ll simply agree with his critics that he could have handled these situations better.

KKK slow denial

Khan controversy

Spastic imitation of Serge Kovaleski

Calling Judge Curiel “Mexican”

Facts (He often ignored them.)

Tough talk (He probably took it too far at rallies.)

I’m leaving out President Trump’s preelection “mistakes,” of which there were many. Trump University is near the top of that list. And talking about grabbing women by the private parts while wearing a hot microphone was clearly a mistake. I don’t think the public needed me to point out the obvious there.

I also acknowledge that Trump had a number of notable business failures over his multidecade entrepreneurial career that spanned several industries. But the economist in me says he cleverly managed his risks so his successes would outshine his failures. Most new businesses fail, and nearly every billionaire with a complicated portfolio has losers in the bunch. Trump used a well-designed system for pursuing business success: He transferred risk to others when he could, and he made sure his projects were in separate entities so they could fail without bringing down the whole enterprise. That’s how Trump could have bankruptcies in his portfolio and still make money. He only needed the winners to be bigger than the losers over time. And that’s what happened. If you are not experienced in business, it would be easy to see the bankruptcies as meaning more than they do.

By far the largest set of mistakes President Trump has made in his lifetime fall into the category of things he could have done better according to me. I’ll grant you the list is long. But I have the same feeling about nearly every public figure.
